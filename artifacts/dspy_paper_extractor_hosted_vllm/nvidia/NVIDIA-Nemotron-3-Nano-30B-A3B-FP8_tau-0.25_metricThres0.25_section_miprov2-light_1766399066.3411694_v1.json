        "section": "The question concerning when retellings of a story like Cinderella can no longer claim the name of Cinderella leads us to another, broader issue: that of the relative importance of the events in a story. Both Roland Barthes and Seymour Chatman argue for a distinction between constituent and supplementary events. Barthes uses the terms \"nuclei\" (noyaux) and \"catalyzers\" (catalyses) for this distinction, and Chatman uses the terms \"kernels\" and \"satellites.\" 9 In this analysis, the constituent events (\"nuclei,\" \"kernels\") are necessary for the story to be the story it is. They are the turning points, the events that drive the story forward and that lead to other events. The supplementary events (\"catalyzers,\" \"satellites\") are not necessary for the story. They don't lead anywhere. They can be removed and the story will still be recognizably the story that it is. On the face of it, this distinction would appear to create a hierarchy in which constituent events are rated more highly than supplementary events. But here we need to be careful. Constituent events are only necessarily more important than supplementary events insofar as we are concerned with the sequence of events that constitute the story itself. But supplementary events can be very important for the meaning and overall impact of the narrative. Barthes puts this well: \"A nucleus [constituent event] cannot be deleted without altering the story, but neither can a catalyzer [supplementary event] without altering the discourse.\" 10 In short, there is more to narrative than story. And in that \"more\" can be much that gives a work its power and significance. In James Whale's 1931 film adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, Frankenstein, the events surrounding the creation of the monster are greatly elaborated beyond what Shelley gave us. In Shelley's novel very little attention is paid to how the monster is put together, but in Whale's version we are given a host of supplementary micro-events involving 1930s high-tech instrumentation. The thickening of narrative texture at this point expresses a shift in cultural attention toward the technology of production -a shift that had evolved during the 113 years since Mary Shelley first published her novel. With this particular enlargement of supplementary business, Whale could load up Shelley's nineteenth-century story about the consequences of scientific over-reaching with twentieth-century anxieties about our relationship with technology. To take another example, a key event of the story in Jean Renoir's 1938 film classic, Grand Illusion, is the downing of a plane in World War I. The French officers Captain de Boeldieu and Lieutenant Maréchal are shot down behind the German lines and captured by troops under the command of General von Rauffenstein (played by Erich von Stroheim). Yet this major constituent event of the story is not shown in the film. At the outset, we see the French officers, preparing to depart. We then find ourselves in the German encampment, where shortly the two officers are brought in through the door. The only visual trace of the first major event of the story is the sling in which Lieutenant Maréchal's arm gracefully reposes. What we are invited to dwell on during the long opening stretch of the narrative discourse is a series of micro-events -a round of dining and conversation in the German general's headquarters -none of which is necessary for the story. But these events do a great deal to establish the ambiance of a world on the verge of extinction, marked by aristocratic courtesy and camaraderie among men of breeding, even though they may be at war. Briefly, to review, constituent events are events that are necessary for the story, driving it forward. Supplementary events are events that do not drive the story forward and without which the story would still remain intact. Naturally, a great deal of the energy, moral significance and revelatory power of a story are released during its constituent events. Lear's division of his kingdom, Macbeth's murder of the king -these constituent events are moments when we see what the protagonist is made of. They are also the moments in which the future is determined. In these regards, the importance of constituent events should not be underrated. But as I have shown above, supplementary events invariably have their own impact and can carry a considerable amount of the narrative's burden of meaning. They also raise an interesting question that constituent events do not: Why were they included? Since they are not necessary to the story, why did the author feel compelled to put them into the narrative? Asking these questions is often a very profitable thing to do in the interpretation of narrative. Just as a language always changes as long as it is alive, so stories are constantly changing in not only their constituent and supplementary events, but their characters, settings, and a whole range of finer and finer details of form and content. In the ancient German Faustbuch, in the two versions of Marlowe's play Doctor Faustus (1604 and 1616), in Goethe's long, barely performable two-part drama, Faust (1808 and 1831), in Thomas Mann's 1947 novel, Doctor Faustus -in all four of these immensely different works we recognize the bone structure of the same story about a man who made a pact with the devil for powers far beyond those of other mortals. We call it the Faust story. Yet almost everything in the story is open to revision, including the name of the central character, whether he falls in love, whether he has children, what craft he practices, whether he is punished for his sins, even whether he lives or dies. Almost all of the narratives of Shakespeare and Chaucer are patchworks of such revisions. The nature of art and culture seems to require this constancy of change. And yet, at the same time, we recognize the persistence of a story as it shows up in different literary incarnations. So if change is inevitable, so too is recurrence. Elements of the story persist even as they are subject to change.",

          "Cross-culturally, women, relative to men, are a disadvantaged group, as indicated by, for example, differences in earnings and the low percentage of women in the most powerful roles in business and government (United Nations Development Programme, 1998). Nevertheless, Eagly and Mladinic (1994) found that women are actually stereotyped more positively than men are, with men as well as women attributing highly favorable traits (e.g., warmth and nurturance) to women. For an antipathy model of prejudice, the coexistence of women's general subordination and Eagly and Mladinic's \"women are wonderful\" effect is a paradox. One alternative is that women are viewed positively on some dimensions, such as warmth, and negatively on others, such as competence (Eagly & Mladinic~ 1994;Fiske, 1998;Fiske et al., 1999;Glick & Fiske, in press). Another related alternative is that subjectively favorable attitudes toward women can themselves be a form of prejudice in that they s~erve to justify and maintain women's subordination. Glick and Fiske (1996) hypothesized that hostile and benevolent attitudes toward women are complementary components of sexism common among past and present human societies. Apart from anecdotal evidence that polarized attitudes toward women (e.g., the virgin-whore dichotomy; Tavris & Wade, 1984) have existed since ancient times (see Pomeroy, 1975), sound theoretical reasons suggest that HS and BS are, and long have been, pervasive prejudices. Glick and Fiske (1996) argued that HS and BS stem from social and biological conditions common to human societies: patriarchy, gender differentiation, and sexual reproduction. Patriarchy (male dominance), varying considerably in degree, is widespread across cultures (Harris, 1991;Pratto, 1996), though not necessarily universal (see Salzman, 1999). Additionally, in most cultures, women and men are differentiated in that (to a greater or lesser extent) they often inhabit different social roles and occupations (Eagly & Wood, 1999) and are attributed different traits (Williams & Best, 1982). Finally, sexual reproduction is a biological constant that is related to social roles, as women's roles are largely defined by childbearing and child rearing (Eagly, 1987), and that promotes intimate relationships between men and women. Patriarchy, gender differentiation, and sexual reproduction combine to create HS and BS. Dominant groups, whether based on gender or other distinctions, inevitably propagate systemjustifying ideologies of their superiority, which are often accepted even by members of socially subordinate groups (Jost & Banaji, 1994; see also Jost & Burgess, 2000;Jost, Burgess, & Mosso, in press). Thus, men's dominance creates HS, hostile attitudes about women. This dominance is largely enacted in and reinforced by gender roles and stereotypes. Furthermore, men often exert their power over women within sexual relationships, and women can potentially counter men's power through sexuality (e.g., by using sexual attractiveness to control men). Therefore, concerns about power, gender differentiation, and sexuality are bound together as components of HS. In a modem context in which social move-ments and increasing gender equality threaten traditional male dominance, HS may be directed most strongly at women who challenge men's power (e.g., feminists) and status (e.g., career women), as well as toward women who are perceived as using their sexual allure to gain power over men (e.g., temptresses). However, sexual reproduction and men's dependence on women to fulfill domestic roles create a dependency and intimacy between the sexes that counterbalances sexist hostility with a subjectively benevolent view of women, BS. Although men dominate crossculturally, they rely on women to produce and to nurture offspring, for domestic labor, and to fulfill sexual and intimacy needs, lending women power in intimate relationships (Guttentag & Secord, 1983). This dependence, Glick and Fiske (1996) argued, precipitates subjectively benevolent but paternalistic attitudes toward women, as men \"can't live without them.\" BS is sexist in that it presumes women's inferiority (it recognizes and reinforces patriarchy by portraying women as needing men to protect and provide for them) hut is subjectively positive (from the perspective of the sexist perceiver) in that it characterizes (at least some) women as wonderful, pure creatures whose love is required to make a man whole. Like I-IS, BS encompasses attitudes related to power, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality. The 22-item Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI; Glick & Fiske, 1996), initially developed and validated in six studies (involving both college students and older adults) in the United States (Glick & Fiske, 1996), is a self-report measure of sexist attitudes composed of separate 11-item I-IS and BS subscales (see Appendix). HS is evidenced by an adversarial view of gender relations in which women are perceived as seeking to control men, whether through sexuality or feminist ideology. Potential HS items that baldly asserted women's inferiority were strongly rejected by respondents in the United States and were therefore not included in the scale. Thus, the I-IS scale is a relatively subtle and contemporary measure of sexist hostility. Nevertheless, given that the predominant theme is a hostile reaction to women challenging men's authority and power, we believe that it is an extension of, and is consistent with, traditional forms of sexist hostility; this belief is supported by moderate to strong correlations (Glick & Fiske, 1996) between HS and measures of blatant sexism such as the Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS; Spence & I-Ielmreich, 1972) and the Old-Fashioned Sexism Scale (Swim, Aikin, Hall, & Hunter, 1995). In contrast, BS items suggest that women are pure creatures who ought to be adored and placed on a pedestal but are also weak and in need of protection. Although the BS scale, because it represents a subtle form of prejudice, is sometimes lumped together with measures of uniquely contemporary forms of sexism such as Modem Sexism (MS; Swim et al., 1995) or Neo-Sexism (NS; Tougas, Brown, Beaton, & Joly, 1995), BS was never hypothesized to be a recent development (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Indeed, BS items have a much less contemporary flavor (e.g., the notion that women are more pure than men) than I-IS items do, perhaps because BS, because of its positive tone, has not been challenged as vigorously in egalitarian societies as has sexist hostility. Unlike the BS scale, the MS and NS measures assume that sexism is an antipathy but that the antipathy is disguised as political and social egalitarianism within cultures that promote this value. The attitudes tapped by the BS scale are not disguised as egalitarian; rather, they seem closer to medieval ideologies of chivalry (Tavris & Wade, 1984) than they are to contemporary \"political correctness.\" BS is rooted in the structure of personal relationships between men and women, not in public politics. The BS scale is correlated moderately strongly with HS, but once this relationship is controlled, it has strong discriminant validity, correlating weakly or not at all with fi variety of other measures of sexism based on an antipathy model, such as the AWS and the MS Scale (Glick & Fiske, 1996;Massel~ & Abrams, 1999). Three subdimensions, related to the underlying structural factors of patriarchy, gender differentiation, and sexual reproduction, consistently emerge as BS subfactors in factor analyses of the ASI: protective paternalism (e.g., women ought to be rescued first in emergencies), complementary gender differentiation (e.g., women are more pure than men), and heterosexual intimacy (e.g., every man ought to have a woman he adores). Although HS scale items also address power relations, gender differentiation, and sexuality, this scale has proven to be unidimensional (see Glick & Fiske, 1996, for speculations as to why this is the case). That HS and BS are complementary ideologies is suggested by their positive correlation. When this correlation is controlled statistically, however, HS predicts negative and BS predicts positive attitudes toward and stereotypes about women (Glick, Diebold, Bailey-Werner, & Zhu, 1997;Glick & Fiske, 1996), supporting the contention that BS is a subjectively positive form of prejudice. Although people who score high on both scales can be characterized as ambivalent toward women, they seem to reconcile their hostile and benevolent attitudes by classifying women into good and bad subtypes, evincing, for example, hostility toward career women and affection for homemakers (Glick et al., 1997). BS may help to legitimate HS by allowing sexist men to conceive of themselves as benefactors of women and to excuse their hostility as being directed only at women who allegedly deserve it. Furthermore, because BS fosters behaviors that are normally deemed prosocial, such as helping or protecting women, women tend to accept rather than challenge BS (Glick & Fiske, 1996;Kilianski & Rudman, 1998). The claim that BS is a form of sexism relies on the putative relationship of BS to the subordination of women. Jackman (1994) illuminated the greater effectiveness of paternalistic prejudices such as BS, as compared with outfight antipathy, in gaining compliance (rather than resistance) from low-status groups. Whereas HS serves to punish women who fail to conform to (male-defined) acceptable roles, BS represents the rewards women reap when they do conform (Glick et al., 1997). Women who embrace conventional, sanctioned roles are protected and revered. As any psychologist knows, reward is far more effective than punishment is in eliciting conformity. Thus, the combination of HS and BS may be particularly effective as complementary justifications or \"legitimating myths\" (Sidanius, Pratto, & Bobo, 1994, p. 999) that serve to maintain gender inequality. Jost and Banaji's (1994) system-justification theory suggests that subordinate groups often accept legitimizing myths that justify the status quo but that acceptance of such ideologies is tempered because overtly hostile ideologies about one's group contradict individual and group interests (Jost et al., in press). In contrast, prejudiced ideologies that are ostensibly benevolent may be seductive to subordinate group members, because they do not appear to contradict self-and group interests. Women may be attracted to BS more than to HS because it not only justifies the system as a whole but also promises rewards from the more powerful group (protection, adoration, intimacy). What may be particularly insidious is that women are likely to value these rewards more highly in cultures in which they perceive many men to be hostile. In highly sexist societies, men provide both the threat (HS) and the solution to the threat (BS and the protection, provision, and affection it promises); women in these societies are presented with a stark choice--reject BS and face the wrath of HS, or accept BS and avoid HS. In more egalitarian societies, women may be freer to reject BS as well as HS, because they are less likely to be as dependent on men for resources and because rejecting BS is not as likely to elicit sexist hostility.",
          "We have hypothesized that sexist prejudice is not expressed through antipathy alone, that HS and BS are complementary sexist ideologies that are common across cultures, and that BS, as well as HS, is related to the oppression of women. These claims--which currently lack supportive evidence and, as far as BS is concerned, can be viewed as contradicting well-established views of prejudice as an antipathy--can be tested rigorously only through crosscultural comparisons. Because the variation between countries in gender equality is measurable (United Nations Development Programme, 1998), cross-national comparisons not only afford a realistic test of the hypothesis that BS goes hand in hand with HS but also test the notion that both BS and HS are related to women's subordination (i.e., that BS is indeed a form of sexism). Specifically, we ask the following questions: (a) Do HS and BS exist--that is, can they be reliably and validly identified--across cultures? (b) As has been found in the United States, are HS and BS positively correlated among respondents within countries, and do average HS and BS scores covary across nations, indicating that HS and BS are mutually supportive sexist ideologies? (c) As in the United States, do HS and BS predict opposing valences in stereotypes about women, confirming that HS is an antagonistic and BS a subjectively favorable orientation toward women? (d) Are women (as compared with men) relatively more accepting of BS than of HS and, across nations, does women's (as compared with men's) acceptance of BS increase when men's sexism is more pronounced? and (e) Across cultures, is BS, as well as HS, related to objective measures of women's oppression, suggesting that both forms of sexism justify and maintain gender inequality?",
          "Researchers in 19 countries administered the ASI, translated in non-English-speaking countries. Even if HS and BS exist across cultures, the ASI scales could be culturally specific, having been developed and validated only in the United States. Cross-cultural psychologists (see Triandis & Marfn, 1983) distinguish between etics, which are universal phenomena, and emics, which are culturally specific (but which can be culture-specific markers for etics). In this terminology, it is possible that the constructs of HS and BS are emics, unique to the United States and possibly Europe (and related nations such as Canada and Australia). Theoretically, however, the constructs of HS and BS ought to be etics, as we have hypothesized that HS and BS originate in social and biological factors common to human groups. Nevertheless, the HS and BS scales might be emics that validly tap the wider constructs only in the United States. If this were the case, culturally specific measures of HS and BS would be necessary. Alternatively, the HS and BS scales may be good indicators of the hypothesized etics in a variety of cultures. From a pragmatic point of view, keeping the measures constant is highly desirable. Culture-specific measures would both be laborintensive to produce and result in comparisons that, though hoped to be appropriate at the level of the hypothesized etics, would be incommensurable at the operational level. Rather than presuming a priori that specific scale items would not generalize, we used the original items and designed our research to provide multiple tests of the validity of the scales by (a) gathering samples large enough to perform confirmatory factor analyses testing alternative models of the factor structure of the ASI--becanse the ASI's structure is complex, its replication would provide significant evidence not only for the coherence of the scale but also for its construct validity; (b) including, where possible, a predictive validity task in which respondents generated their spontaneous stereotypes of women and then rated the valence of each trait they generated, to test whether HS predicts negative and BS predicts positive trait valences; and (c) correlating, across countries, national means on HS and BS with the United Nations indices of national gender equality, on the basis of objective measures (e.g., percentage of professionals who are women, educational level of men and women).",

          "The ASI was filled out by over 15,000 respondents (both men and women) in 19 nations: Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States) Sample sizes ranged from about 250 to 1,600 respondents (with most samples having over 500 respondents). In some cases, several sampies were collected and combined within a country. In all but one case (the Netherlands), the samples cannot be presumed to be representative of the country in which they were gathered. In some countries (Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, England, Italy, Japan, Portugal, South Africa, Turkey, the United States) the respondents were exclusively college students, typically recruited in classes. In other countries, participants were more diverse: Almost all (90%) of the respondents in the Netherlands were from a representative national sample, and almost all (over 90%) of the male respondents and 50% of the female respondents in Spain were from community samples. Approximately 50% of the respondents in Australia and Botswana, 40% in South Korea, and a significant minority of respondents in Chile (25%), Germany (20%), and Nigeria (20%) were Older adults from more diverse backgrounds. Like most respondents, the countries were not randomly selected. Nevertheless, this set of nations represents considerable geographic, cultural, and economic diversity, as well as significant variation on the United Nations indices of national gender equality (the countries ranged from the 15th to the 95th percentile on the Gender Empowermeat Measure, or GEM, described in the following section).",
          "Researchers in each non-English-speaking country translated and back-translated the 22-item version of the ASI. The coauthors in each nation served as cultural informants about the appropriateness of individual ASI items, and many noted that reverse-worded items from the original ASI (which are framed as negative statements) did not typically translate well (a perception conf'n'rned by poor loadings on later factor analyses). Because some samples were collected with reversed wording and other, later samples were collected with nonreversed wording for these six items, the items were eliminated from all reported analyses, so that the measure was comparable across samples. 2 For future cross-cultural work, however, we recommend the full scale with nonreversed wording for all items, as reproduced in the Appendix. Stereotypes of women. In 12 countries, some or all participants generated, in a free-response format, up to 10 personality traits that most quickly came to mind as being characteristics the participant associates with women. Participants then indicated how negative or positive they thought each trait was by rating each trait on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from -3 (extremely negative) to 3 (extremely positive). The strength of this measure is that it assesses respondents' spontaneous stereotypes (rather than supplying a list of traits determined by the researcher, which might be appropriate for some cultures and not others) and allows respondents to define the subjective positivity or negativity of each trait. United Nations indices of gender equality. The United Nations Development Programme (1998) has published two objective indices of national gender equality. The GEM assesses women's (relative to men's) actual participation in the economy (percentage of administrators, managers, and professional and technical workers who are women, women's share of earned income) and in politics (percentage of parliament seats held by women). The larger the GEM, the more gender equality there is in a country's economic and political life. The Gender-Related Development Index (GDI) is a form of the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI), which focuses on longevity (life expectancy), knowledge (adult literacy rates, years of schooling), and standard of living (purchasing power). The GDI uses the same measures as the HDI, but the score is decreased for gender inequality (e.g., women having a lower literacy rate). The greater the gender disparity, the lower the GDI is relative to the HDI.",

          "If the ASI's complex factor structure replicates in various nations, this would support our contention that HS and BS are pervasive forms of sexism arising from common aspects of the human condition. Although in U.S. samples, the HS scale has proven to be unidimensional, the BS scale has consistently demonstrated three predicted subcomponents--protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy (Glick & Fiske, 1996). For each national sample, confirmatory factor analyses (using LISREL 8.0; Jtireskog & Stirbom, 1993) tested the fit of several alternative models: (a) a one-factor model (all items assess a general sexism factor--a plausible model, as HS and BS are typically positively correlated), (b) a two-factor model (the items load on separate, though correlated, HS and BS factors, but no BS Portions of the data from some countries are published elsewhere: Chile (Mladinic, Saiz, Diaz, Ortega, & Oyarce, 1998), Germany (Eckes & Six-Materna, 1999), South Korea (Kim, 1998), Spain (Exptsito, Moya, & Glick, 1998), and the United States (Glick & Fiske, 1996). 2 Glick and Fiske (1996) provided evidence that the relationship of the ASI to other sexism measures is similar when no items are reverse-worded, as compared with when some items are reverse-worded. Analyses in which the reverse-worded items were included for the current samples did not substantially change the ASI means, HS-BS correlations, or the ASI scales' relationships to other measures (e.g., the United Nations indices). subfactors are distinguished), (c) a 4-factor model (HS, protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy; this model treats the hypothesized BS subfactors as independent factors that are not nested within an overall BS factor), and (d) a preferred model (HS, in addition to BS with three subfactors). In the preferred model, BS encompasses the three subfactors (rather than treating them as independent factors). The preferred model is a stringent one in which the BS subfactors are restricted from correlating directly with HS. Because HS and BS are thought to be complementary aspects of sexism, however, these two general factors are allowed to correlate. The fit of the various models is shown in Table 1. The primary measure of model fit is the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), which is standardized on a 0-1 scale, allowing for direct comparisons across samples of differing sizes. Comparisons of the relative fit of different models within each sample, however, require the chi-square difference test (Bollen, 1989), which determines whether differences in fit are statistically significant. Because large samples are needed to achieve stable and accurate factor solutions (especially with the relatively complex model tested here), results for samples of fewer than 500 respondents should be considered potentially unstable. Using the chi-square difference test, we compared the alternative models (one-factor, two-factor, and four-factor) with the preferred model (HS, in addition to BS with three subfactors, which past research has established as the best fit in U.S. samples). In all but three nations, the preferred model was statistically superior to all of the alternative models, with chi-squares significant at p < .01. In Cuba and Japan, although the preferred model fit significantly better than the one-factor and four-factor models, it did not exceed the fit of the two-factor model, and in Colombia, the preferred model only exceeded the fit of the one-factor model. Overall, with few exceptions, the preferred model had the best fit (and in two of the three exceptional samples, Colombia and Cuba, the number of participants was fewer than the recommended minimum for performing factor analysis). In general, fits of the preferred model were within the range established previously in U.S. samples of similar size (GFIs in the low .90s for large samples and high .80s for small samples). In the United States, the fit of the preferred model has proven to be similar for both women and men. Among the current samples, there were nine of sufficient size (at least 300 participants of each gender: Brazil, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, Nigeria, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, the United States) to test the preferred model by fitting it simultaneously but separately for men and women (J6reskog & S6rbom, 1993). The most stringent test required the same parameters (i.e., identical factor loadings and factor correlations) for both genders. The GFIs for this comparison ranged from .88 (Spain) to .93 (the United States). Because HS-BS correlations have differed for men and women in some U.S. samples, we let the HS-BS factor correlations vary to achieve a better fit. These analyses yielded acceptable GFIs ranging from .90 (the Netherlands, Turkey) to .93 (Germany, the United States), indicating similar models for women and men with, in some cases, possible differences in HS-BS correlations (an issue explored in detail later in this article). Overall, the factor analytic results support the hypothesis that HS and BS are not specific to the United States but are coherent ideologies evident across cultures and that the ASI is a valid measure of these constructs, at least in the countries tested. Furthermore, the general superiority of the preferred model, as compared with the alternatives, suggests that (a) HS and BS are separate constructs (as shown by comparisons with the one-factor model), (b) BS has separable subfactors (as shown by comparisons with the two-factor model), and (c) the BS subfactors are best conceived as being nested within an overall BS scale (as shown by comparison with the four-factor model). a Fit is significantly better than all alternative models at p < .01. b Fit is significantly better than one-factor and four-factor models at p < .01. ¢ Fit is significantly better than one-factor model at p < .01. ",
          "The remaining analyses involve raw ASI scores (not factor scores). The unidimensional HS scale, with alphas ranging from .68 to .89, proved (as in prior U.S. samples) more internally consistent than the multidimensional BS subscale, for which alphas ranged from .53 to .84. We also examined the reliability of each BS subscale. Across countries, the mean alphas for each scale were .54 for protective paternalism, .61 for complementary gender differentiation, and .54 for heterosexual intimacy. Within each country, alphas for each of the BS subfactors were always lower than the alpha for the overall BS scale was. The alphas for BS were lowest in the three African samples and the Cuban sample (ranging from .53 to .57, with all other samples at .64 or higher). Item-total correlations in these cases did not suggest that any specific BS items were to blame; rather, most of the item-total correlations were weak. We do not believe that the low alphas are particularly worrisome, given that (a) BS is a multidimensional scale and therefore ought to show lower internal consistency (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955), and (b) the LISREL factor analyses, which are more sophisticated analyses of scale structure than alpha is and which correct for error variance, show extremely good fit for the preferred factor model for all three African countries (GFIs of .93 to .94) and acceptable fit for the (relatively small) Cuban sample (GFI = .87).",
          "In U.S. samples (with the exception of adult men in two small samples; Glick & Fiske, 1996), HS and BS are typically correlated in the .40 to .50 range, supporting the notion that although HS and BS are distinct (as factor analyses consistently show), they both are forms of sexism. Table 2 reports correlations between HS and BS scale scores within each country. The results are fairly consistent, with significant positive correlations appearing for both men and women in most countries, with the exception of men in Belgium, Botswana, Italy, Nigeria, and Portugal and both men and women in South Africa. In some U.S. samples, HS-BS correlations were stronger for women than for men, suggesting that men's hostile and benevolent attitudes may be more differentiated than women's (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Significant gender differences, with women's correlations higher than men's, occurred in 10 countries: Botswana, Cuba, England, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, and Turkey (see Table 2 for z tests). Comparing across the 19 nations, the average HS-BS correlation among men (r = .23) was significantly smaller than the average correlation for women (r = .37), t(18) = 5.02, p < .01. Despite these gender differences, the trend was toward significantly positive HS-BS correlations in most countries (13 of 19 for men, 18 of 19 for women). 3",
          "Prior research in the United States has shown that despite the positive oorrelatiorj between the scales, HS predicts negative and BS predicts positive attitudes toward and stereotypes about women. In 12 countries, some or all respondents were asked to 3 We also examined the correlations of each BS subscale with the HS scale, separately for women and men. The BS subfactors correlated weakly to moderately with HS. The correlations with HS averaged across countries were, for men and women respectively, .21 and .37 for Protective Paternalism, .14 and .28 for Complementary Gender Differentiation, and .20 and .26 for Heterosexual Intimacy. For the countries in which the HS-BS correlation was low for men, there was no discernable pattern such that any single subfactor accounted for the lack of HS-BS correlation (i.e., in these cases all BS subfactors were weakly, usually nonsignificantly, correlated with HS). generate up to 10 traits they associate with women and then rate each trait on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from -3 (extremely negative) to 3 (extremely positive). Often, this task was given only to a subset of respondents, so sample sizes are smaller for these analyses. For each respondent, the positive-negative ratings (of the Waits that the respondent associated with women) were averaged. Examples of traits generated include tender, warm, sweet, and sensitive (all positively valenced) and jealous, sly, touchy, and selfish (all negatively valenced). We expected that once the positive intelrelationslfip was partialed out, HS would predict negative and BS would predict positive trait ascriptions to women. Table 3 shows the partial correlations (each ASI subscale partialed from the other) of HS and BS to the average trait ratings. When male and female respondents were pooled together, the pattern of correlations was completely as we expected: HS correlated negatively and BS positively with trait ratings, with 22 of 24 correlations reaching statistical significance. Analyzing male and female respondents separately revealed less consistent results; although all significant correlations were in the predicted direction, only about two thirds of the correlations were statistically significant. These less consistent results may be the consequence of smaller sample sizes. The higher proportion of significant correlations for female participants may also be a function of sample size. In the two countries in which both the HS and the BS correlations were nonsignificant for men, the sample size was fewer than 50 male respondents, whereas sample sizes for women were two to three times larger. The majority of the correlations support the predictive validity of the HS and BS scales; when correlations were significant, HS predicted subjectively negative and BS subjectively positive stereotypes about women. 4",
          "Because the samples presented here (with the exception of the Netherlands) cannot be considered representative of the countries in which they were collected, due caution must be exercised when making cross-national comparisons of mean HS and BS scores. In addition, variations in interpretations of items because of cultural differences (even between English-speaking countries) and the inevitable slippage in translations no doubt make fine-grained analyses of mean differences a dubious enterprise. 5 Mean comparisons between men and women within each country, however, do not suffer from the problems just delineated. 6 In U.S. samples, men typically scored higher than women on HS, but the gender gap (though still significant) was mitigated for BS scores, presumably because HS punishes women, whereas BS potentially rewards them with protection, idealization, and affection. Means for each national sample on HS and BS ale presented in Figures 1 and2, respectively. In all countries, men scored significantly higher than women did on HS. In the vast majority of countries, however, the gender 4 We also examined, separately for women and men, the correlations of each BS subscale with the average trait valence, partialing out HS. The partial correlations with trait valence, averaged across countries, for men and women respectively, were .18 and .17 for Protective Paternalism, . 19 and .11 for Complementary Gender Differentiation,and .13 and .11 for Heterosexual Intimacy. There was no particular pattern such that any single subfactor accounted for the correlation of BS to trait valence. Moreover, a 1 to 7 (rather than the usual 0 to 5) rating scale was used in England. For mean analyses, a formula derived from Aiken (1987) was used to approximate a 0 to 5 scale: -.5 + 6 (score -.5)/7. 6 There was one exception to the comparability of men and women within each nation. The first sample of women gathered from Spain (n = 216) were third-year psychology students (rather than a community sample, as was the case with the men) who exhibited anomalously low scores on the ASI scales, particularly on HS (M = 1.09, over half a point lower than women in any other nation). Because of their advanced work in psychology (which included a week-long seminar on gender issues in the class in which they filled out the ASI), these students may have been particularly sensitive to the intent of the scale. As a result, a more diverse sample of 223 women (to match the community sample of Spanish men) were given the ASI, and we excluded the advanced female psychology students from all analyses involving mean comparisons or correlations of national means on the ASI scales. difference in BS scores was significantly less, disappeared, or even reversed itself such that in some countries women scored higher than men on BS. A 2 (gender of participant) × 2 (ASI subscale: HS, BS) analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each sample (with ASI subscale treated as a repeated measures factor) yielded a significant gender of participant main effect in all cases, all Fs > 4.28, p < .05, such that men exhibited higher scores when HS and BS were averaged together. In all but three countries (Australia, Japan, and the Netherlands), however, this main effect was qualified by a Gender of Participant X ASI Subscale interaction, all significant Fs > 13.05, p < .01. The nature of the interaction was of two types: (a) a large gender difference in HS scores became a smaller or nonsignificant gender difference in BS scores or (b) the gender difference was reversed for BS, such that women scored higher on BS than men did. The HS gender difference was statistically significant in all samples, all ts > 2.55, p < .01. The BS gender difference, smaller in magnitude, was nonsignificant in nine countries (Belgium, Chile, Colombia, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and Turkey). Furthermore, although in six countries (Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, and the United States), men scored significantly higher in BS than did women, all ts > 2.25, p < .05, the Gender of Participant x ASI Scale interactions indicate that in four of the six cases--with Australia and the Netherlands being the exceptions--the BS gender difference was significantly smaller than the HS gender difference. Finally, in Cuba and in the three African nations (Botswana, Nigeria, and South Africa), women's BS scores were actually higher than men's, all ts < -3.04, p < .01. In summary, cross-culturally, women (in comparison with men) rejected HS but often accepted BS, even to the point, in some nations, of endorsing BS significantly more strongly than men did.",
          "We had predicted that just as HS and BS typically go together at the level of individual respondents' attitudes, they would tend to go hand in hand at the national level of analysis. National means on HS correlated extremely strongly with mean BS scores, both among men, r = .89, p < .01, and among women, r = .89, p < .01. Thus, as we expected, in countries where the endorsement of HS was high, endorsement of BS was also high. The strength of these correlations supports the idea that HS and BS act as complementary forms of sexism. If the system-justification hypothesis that subordinates tend to accept ideologies promoted by dominant groups is correct, then men's level of sexism ought to predict women's agreement with sexist ideologies. Men's HS scores correlated highly with women's mean scores on HS, r = .84,p < .01, and on BS, r = .92,p < .01. Similarly, men's BS scores were highly correlated with women's average scores both on HS, r = .84, p < .01, and on BS, r = .97, p < .01. In other words, in countries where men were more sexist, women had a greater tendency to embrace sexist ideologies, both hostile and benevolent. Although this evidence is correlational, it is consistent with the system-justification hypothesis that members of subordinate groups adopt the system-justifying ideologies of dominant groups. It is important to keep in mind, however, that within each nation women, on average, uniformly endorsed HS to a lesser degree than men did. In contrast, even in those countries where women rejected BS more than men did, the BS scores typically showed less of a gender gap, and in four nations there was a reversal, with women scoring significantly higher than men did.",
          "The strength of the gender gap in HS and BS scores varied across countries. We had hypothesized that some of this variation would be systematic, in particular that women would be less likely, relative to men, to reject BS in cultures in which men are more highly sexist. In contrast, we hypothesized that as men's overall level of sexism increased across nations, the more likely it would be for the HS gender gap to increase, because for hostile ideologies, system justification is tempered by women's self-and group interests. We correlated, across nations, the gender gaps in HS and BS scores (men's mean minus women's mean), both with men's mean HS scores and with their mean BS scores. Men's HS (r = -.75, p < .01) and BS (r = -.65, p < .01) means were negatively correlated with the gender gap in BS (i.e., predicted a smaller or reversed difference between men's and women's BS scores). In contrast, the gender gap in HS was positively related to men's average HS (r = .61, p < .01) and BS (r = .41, p < .10) scores (i.e., the more HS and BS were endorsed by men, the more strongly women, relative to men, rejected HS). These opposing relationships fit our hypothesis: The more sexism pervades a culture, the more women are, relative to men, likely to embrace BS but to reject HS. 7",
          "We noticed post hoc that nations in which respondents exhibited low HS-BS correlations tended to be those with higher overall sexism scores. Across nations, men's HS and BS means correlated -.65 (p < .01) and -.49 (p < .05), respectively, with men's HS-BS correlations; women's HS and BS means correlated -.30 (ns) and -.52 (p < .05), respectively, with women's HS-BS correlations. Given that the HS-BS correlation is weaker among respondents in more sexist nations, perhaps it is also weaker among more sexist individuals. This might explain why men, who tend to score higher on sexism than women do, often show lower HS-BS correlations. Within each national sample, we performed a median split (separately for men and women) on HS scores and then computed separate HS-BS correlations for high and low HS scorers (we chose HS arbitrarily; a median split on BS would presumably yield similar results). These new HS-BS correlations were then used for cross-national comparisons. We performed a 2 (gender of respondent) × 2 (level of HS: high vs. low) ANOVA using the HS-BS correlations for each sample as the dependent variable. Because this ANOVA was performed with nations as the unit of analysis, both independent variables were treated as repeated measures (i.e., there were high-and low-HS-scoring men and women in each nation). There was a significant main effect such that across nations, people who scored higher on HS (average r = .07) exhibited weaker HS-BS correlations than did those who scored lower on HS (average r = .26), F (1,18) = 37.48, p < .01. The interaction term was nonsignificant, F(1, 18) = 1.47. In summary, at the level of individual respondents, HS-BS correlations decreased as, across nations, mean sexism scores increased. A similar phenomenon occurred when, within each nation, men and women were divided into low and high scorers on sexism (using HS scores): The more sexist individuals tended to exhibit weaker HS-BS correlations. Thus, the tendency for men, as compared with women, to show weaker HS-BS correlations may occur because they are typically more sexist than women are.",
          "Sexist ideologies maintain as well as reflect societal gender inequality; therefore, across nations, HS and BS means should be negatively correlated with national indicators of gender equality. Admittedly, our data are imperfect for these cross-cultural comparisons, given that (a) people in all but one of our samples cannot be presumed to be representative of their country and (b) we have data from only 19 nations (which, given that nation becomes the unit of analysis, means that our N is low). These factors should, however, work against the possibility of finding significant crosscultural correlations between the ASI and gender inequality rather than privilege our hypothesis. 8 7 Women's mean HS and BS scores, which are correlated in the .80 to .90 range with men's HS and BS means, were also strongly related to the gender gap in BS, though not to the gender gap in HS. Women's HS and BS means,respectively, to the gender gap in BS, but only .08 (ns) and .39 (p < .10) to the gender gap in HS. 8 Some readers may wonder whether correlations of the ASI scales to the United Nations measures might be an artifact of the types of samples taken in each country. If (a) more diverse (nonstodent) community samples produced higher means and (b) diversity of sample was confounded with traditionality of country, the correlations between the ASI scales and United Nations indices might be inflated. This scenario is unlikely, given that type of sample and national sexism scores were not confounded in this manner. The country with the highest proportion of nonstudents was the Netherlands (highly egalitarian), and about 50% of the sample from another of the most egalitarian nations, Australia, were older adults. Among the countries scoring highest in sexism, the samples from Botswana, Cuba, Colombia, South Africa, and Turkey were exclusively, and the samples from Nigeria and Chile were predominantly (75-80%), composed of university students. About 40% of the respondents in the South Korean sample were working adults, but their means were similar to the students' means. We correlated men's and women's means on HS and BS with the two United Nations indices of gender equality. It is important to recall that the GEM assesses women's presence in elite, highstatus jobs in business (e.g., as managers) and government (e.g., as parliament members), whereas the GDI assesses women's level of development in education, longevity, and standard of living. Because nations with higher human development more generally are likely to have higher GDI scores (simply because the nation as a whole is wealthier), we controlled for national HDI scores when correlating HS and BS to the GDI. The correlations are reported in Table 4. Because men are the dominant group, their scores might be expected to be most predictive of gender inequality. Despite the limitations of our sampling, men's national means on both HS and BS tended to be negatively correlated with the GDI and the GEM. 9 Although the correlation of men's mean BS scores with the GDI and GEM were only marginally significant, the magnitude of these correlations was roughly similar to the significant correlations of men's HS scores to the United Nations statistics. Women's mean HS and BS scores were (marginally significantly) related only to the GEM, not to the GDI. Overall, the results suggest that both HS and BS are predictive of gender inequality.",
          "Prejudice is not synonymous with antipathy; the cross-cultural data presented here show that sexism encompasses subjectively benevolent as well as hostile orientations toward women. Although it is premature to claim that HS and BS are human universals, they do seem (as predicted) to be recognizable, coherent ideologies in a variety of nations, as demonstrated by the consistent replication of the complex factor structure of the ASI. The extremely strong (.80 to .90) correlations between mean levels of HS and BS across nations supports the notion that at the societal level of analysis, these are complementary forms of sexism. The HS-BS correlations among respondents within countries were more modest but (when significant) always in a positive direction, as well. Despite the positive correlation, BS generally predicted positive and HS generally predicted negative trait ascriptions when participants indicated the valence of their spontaneous stereotypes of women. Finally, cross-cultural comparisons showed that HS and BS means predicted the degree of gender inequality across nations: As HS and BS means increased, gender equality, as indicated by United Nations indices of women's empowerment (representation in highpowered roles in government and industry) and development (longevity, education, standard of living) decreased (although some correlations were marginally significant and the GDI was related only to men's, not to women's, mean sexism scores). In general, a high degree of cross-cultural consistency occurred in several domains: the structure of the ASI; the tendency for women, relative to men, to reject HS more so than BS; and the association of BS with more positive and HS with more negative spontaneous stereotypes of women. Furthermore, cross-cultural variations in findings were typically systematic and predictable: The fluctuations in HS and BS means from nation to nation were related to indices of national gender equality, the size of the gender gap in BS and in HS means correlated (the former negatively and the latter positively) with the overall level of sexism across nations, and the strength of HS-BS correlations was negatively related to overall sexism levels across countries. The finding that in more sexist (as compared with less sexist) countries HS and BS scores tended toward greater independence was replicated at the individual level: HS-BS correlations were lower among high-HS than among low-HS scorers. These results suggest an explanation for previous findings that HS and BS tend to be less strongly correlated for men than for women--men generally have higher sexism scores. Perhaps people who are highly egalitarian are more likely to recognize BS as a form of sexism and reject it along with HS (with fewer of these individuals rejecting HS but accepting BS), creating more low-low scores that inflate the HS-BS correlation. An implication of the weaker HS-BS correlations among more sexist respondents is that many sexist individuals are more purely hostile or benevolent rather than ambivalent toward women (i.e., a sexist individual might endorse one ideology and not the other). However, it is important to keep in mind that at the societal level, HS and BS increased or decreased in tandem. Across nations, men's mean sexism scores strongly predicted women's mean scores on both HS and BS, providing evidence consistent with the notion that disadvantaged groups adopt the system-justifying beliefs of dominant groups (Jost & Banaji, 1994); as men's sexism increased, so did women's acceptance of sexist ideologies. However, for HS, women's system-justifying tendency had its limits. Women in every country studied were (on average) significantly less accepting of HS than men were. Furthermore, across countries, the gender gap between women's and men's HS scores increased along with the level of men's sexism, suggesting an increasing resistance to accepting a hostile environment. In contrast, the gender gap in BS scores showed the opposite relationship to men's mean sexism scores: The more sexist the 9 Although past practice has been to use partial correlations to control for the positive HS-BS relationship when using the scales as predictors, the overwhelming correlation between HS and BS means when nations are the unit of analysis (in the .80 to .90 range) makes it impossible to pull the scales apart statistically. nation, the more women, relative to men, accepted BS, even to the point, in the four nations with the highest mean sexism scores (Botswana, Cuba, Nigeria, South Africa), of endorsing BS significantly more than men did. In general, relative to men, women were more accepting of BS than of HS, suggesting that members of subordinate groups fmd ostensibly benevolent prejudice more acceptable than hostile prejudice toward their group. The evidence is consistent with the idea that women adopt BS as a form of self-defense when overall levels of sexism in a culture are high. HS and BS work together as a particularly effective method of system maintenance: When men are high in HS, women have a strong incentive to accept BS to gain men's protection, admiration, and affection and as a means of avoiding men's hostility. Faced with hostility from a more powerful group if they choose to reject conventional female roles and rewarded with men's benevolence for conforming to those roles, it is not surprising that many women choose to adopt prescribed roles and the ideology (BS) that supports them (see also Eagly, 1987;Jackman, 1994;Ridgeway, 1992). This is similar to arguments made by Smuts (1996) and Jackman (1994) that the threat of male aggression leads women to seek protection by pair bonding with men. Such effects are ironic, as women are driven to seek protection from members of the very group that threatens or oppresses them, and the greater the threat (i.e., the more men endorse HS), the stronger the incentive to seek male protection (rather than independence). Is women's relative willingness to accept BS a problem? Although men's mean BS scores were only marginally significantly related to the United Nations gender inequality measures, the findings were consistent across both indices of gender inequality. Furthermore, the extremely strong (.80 to .90) relationships between HS and BS means (both for men and for women) across countries are striking: In this set of nations, higher BS scores were a constant companion to high HS means. That HS and BS go so strongly together is consistent with the notion that BS legitimates HS by allowing sexist men to see themselves not as hostile dominators of women but as their protectors, admirers, and intimates. Furthermore, BS may also be effective in undermining or preventing attempts by women to achieve equality by rewarding them for enacting conventional gender roles and by deflating the resentment they feel about men's greater power (as one is less likely to resent another's power if that power is used to protect oneself). This may explain why women's endorsement of sexist ideologies was related only to the GEM, which measures women's presence in elite occupations and roles, and not to the GDI, which measures women' s overall standard of living. In societies in which women accept sexist attitudes, many women may still be able to achieve a decent standard of living through men's provision but may be less likely to pursue male-dominated elite occupations and roles. In short, BS and HS appear together because they are the ideological expression of a complementary system of rewards and punishments that elicit women's cooperation in their own subordination (cf. Jackman, 1994). BS may continue to have an important role in maintaining sexism even in increasingly egalitarian societies. Whereas HS becomes a lightning rod for criticism and eliminating HS is the goal of those aiming for social improvement, the more subtle, seemingly favorable views of women related to BS are less likely to be questioned. Virginia Woolf (1981) realized that true gender equality will only happen when \"womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation\" (p. 40), but many women, as well as men, may remain resistant to such a change. Fortunately, our data suggest that reducing men's HS may free women to reject BS as well as HS. The cross-cultural comparisons we present are limited. Clearly, future research that replicates these findings with more representative samples from a wider array of nations is desirable. Nevertheless, our preliminary evidence offers substantial support for the cross-cultural prevalence of HS and BS. Furthermore, the strong relationships of BS to HS (with national means correlated in the .80 to .90 range across countries) and to women's subordination (as measured by objective indicators of gender equality) suggest that it is time to rethink the equation of prejudice with antipathy. BS is not simply patronizing but may be just as important as HS in justifying and maintaining gender inequality. Untempered by paternalistic benevolence, hostility toward women would likely arouse only resistance and recalcitrance from a group on whom men are dependent in their most intimate relationships; BS disarms this resistance. The idealization of women who fulf'fll male-defined roles and needs is a crucial complement to the demonization of those who defy male power and authority, creating a particularly effective system of social control whose grip women in many societies are still struggling to break."

        "section": "News source sharing patterns across the partisan news continuum. If partisan motives dictate both fake and real news sharing, social media users should share news sources with similar political leanings, especially near the partisan extremes of the news continuum. To test this, Figure 3 plots a heatmap of correlations based on news sharing across the seven news source types. The emerging patterns firmly favor a partisan story: People who share the most articles from ideologically biased real news sources are also most likely to share fake news sources with a similar political bias. In contrast, the off-diagonal correlations show that people shy away from sharing politically opposed sources. Importantly, the plot also reveals a partisan asymmetry. Whereas sharing *pro*-Republican real news correlates highly with sharing *pro*-Republican fake news, the correlation is substantially weaker between sharing *pro*-Democratic fake and real news. Instead, participants sharing *pro*-Democratic real news often share centrist news as well. Thus, while social media users generally favor partisan news sources, the effect is most pronounced in the Republican end of the continuum. 4 In SM Section 4, we present a series of additional robustness tests. First, we show that our results hold after removing 61 panelists who followed -or were being followed by -at least one other panelist. Second, we demonstrate that applying YouGov sample-matching weights do not alter our results. Third, we re-run models that control for age and partisanship; this does not change our results. Fourth, we leverage a potentially better measure of digital literacy (Hargittai and Hsieh 2011); using this measure does not change our substantive conclusions. Fifth, we show that our results are robust to an alternative coding scheme that treats InfoWars as a *pro*-Republican fake news source rather than a real news source. Further, SM Section 8 shows that our conclusions remain intact when using an alternative list of fake news sources compiled by Grinberg et al. (2019). The predictive power of partisanship across the partisan news continuum. If news sources differ systematically in how strongly their content caters to partisan motivations, then the association between partisanship and sharing should be stronger for news sources located at the extremes of the news source continuum. Figure 4 tests this assertion. The left-hand panel plots estimated logistic regression coefficients from models that examine the association between a seven-point partisanship scale (re-scaled to range from 0 = Democratic Identifier to 1 = Republican Identifier) and sharing content from the seven news source types, while the right-hand panel gives raw counts of shared links stacked by participants' partisanship (where, to ease interpretation, we trichotomize the partisanship scale). Overall, Figure 4 provides more evidence in favor of the partisan logic of news sharing: Both panels show that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to share extreme *pro*-Republican news    Left-hand panels: Headlines shared on Twitter by panelists (upper panel) and headlines scraped from front pages of news sources (lower panel). Red dots: Headlines that mention Republican politicians. Blue dots: Headlines that mention Democratic politicians. In the lower panel, we scraped headlines from the following news sources: Fake Republican: babylonbee.com, dailywire.com, ilovemyfreedom.org, theconservativetreehouse.com, iotwreport.com; Strong Republican: breitbart.com, dailycaller.com, freebeacon.com, nypost.com, townhall.com; Lean Republican: foxnews.com, hotair.com, telegraph.co.uk, washingtonexaminer.com, washingtontimes.com; Center: thehill.com, usatoday.com, npr.com, bbc.com, wsj.com; Lean Democratic: politico.com, nbcnews.com, nytimes.com, theguardian.com, washingtonpost.com; Strong Democratic: alternet.org, dailykos.com, huffingtonpost.com, rawstory.com, vox.com; Fake Democratic: bipartisanreport.com, indiatimes.com, newspunch.com, palmerreport.com, themindunleashed.com. Righthand panels: Headline counts from news sources, conditional on whether headline mentions Republican elites, Democratic elites, or both. Note that headlines mentioning both Republicans and Democrats counted twice in the sentiment analysis. See SM Section 11 and 12 for details on the analysis. are negative towards Democrats. We can go further. For partisans, a critical consideration when promoting news sources on social media is not just the level of negativity expressed towards the out-party. Instead, the most politically useful news source is one that is negative towards the out-party and positive towards the in-party. This implies that we should also examine, for each type of news source, the difference in negativity between mentions of Republican and Democratic elites in Figure 5. Recall that Democrats are more likely to share centrist news sources while Republican partisans prefer fake news sources. The net differences in headline sentiment when mention- We suspect this explains why Republican partisans find fake news more appealing than do Democratic partisans. To get a steady supply of news that caters to their political tastes, Republicans must turn to more extreme news sources, including those known to publish falsehoods. Democrats, in contrast, will have to look no further than to Centrist and *pro*-Democratic real news sources to meet their partisan goals. Importantly, this explanation cannot easily be dismissed by a \"self-selection\" story in which Republican panelists simply decide to share more extreme stories. Focusing on the front page headlines of stories journalists and editors have deemed sufficiently newsworthy to write and publish leads to the same conclusion. Still, whether this speculation is warranted, the combined observations point to an astonishing overlap in the asymmetries in (1) the sources shared by Democrat and Republican partisans, respectively, and (2) the tone of the stories shared from these sources when covering Democratic and Republican elites, respectively. Together, these three analyses corroborate that Republicans approach news source types as if they are placed on a one-dimensional partisan continuum. Democratic partisans, to be sure, do too, but with the very important exception that *pro*-Democratic fake news sources are less attractive to highly polarized Democrats when we compare (a) Democrats to Republicans and (b) *pro*-Democratic fake news to traditional *pro*-Democratic news sources. As we turn to below, this overall pattern suggests that the sharing of fake news is This suggests that fake news sharing is \"business as usual,\" dictated by the same logic partisans use to process other types of information, including real news. From a partisan motivated perspective, fake news is not categorically different from other sources of political information. As the analyses of the news content showed, partisans' decisions to share both fake and real news sources depend on how politically useful they are in derogating the out-party. Under some circumstances, this goal is best achieved with stories from fake news websites. Under other circumstances, this can best be achieved by stories from more credible websites. To the partisan mind, fake news is the extreme end of a news source continuum where the news sources differ in how well they cater to partisan goals. Accordingly, when deciding to share a story from a fake news website, most people do not prioritize whether the story is true or not. This helps explain why cognitive reflection is not related to fake news sharing even though it correlates with the ability to discern fake news from real news. These abilities are not employed in the context of real-life sharing decisions. At the same time, the sum of findings does suggest a dual involvement of accuracy-oriented and goal-oriented motivations. First, fake news sharing is a relatively rare phenomenon that flourishes only among small segments of the population. Like others, and in contrast to what some commentators have feared, we find that only 11% of our participants shared stories from fake news sources during our period of study while half of the participants shared stories from real news web domains. Second, as discussed below, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to share fake news (e.g., Guess, Nagler and Tucker 2019), even though fake news could help Democrats achieve their partisan goals. This suggests that social media users prioritize the usefulness of information when making sharing decisions but prefer useful information that is true rather than false; they care about the veracity of news as long as it does not compromise its usefulness. Two observations merit further discussion. First, it is relevant to discuss the finding that negative feelings towards political opponents rather than positive feelings towards the inparty are the strongest predictor of fake news sharing. There is strong evidence that partisans generally prefer helping the in-party rather than hurting the out-party (Lelkes and Westwood 2017). A hostile political climate, however, may shift the balance. Research suggests that the danger of \"symbolic\" threats against the moral values of one's group can make it \"necessary to strike back, to undermine the credibility of the opposition, and to 'hit them where it hurts\"' (Amira, Wright and Goya-Tocchetto 2019). Twitter -with its fast diffusion of moralizing and emotion-laden political content (Brady et al. 2017) -may have fostered such a hostile environment, making considerations of hurting the out-party loom larger when deciding which news stories to share. Second, we found a significant partisan asymmetry: Republicans were more likely than Democrats to share fake news sources. This could reflect that Republicans are less motivated by accuracy-motivations than Democrats. Yet, accuracy motivations have low explanatory power overall and additional analyses presented in the replication code show that that the associations between ignorance-related variables and fake news sharing do not consistently differ between Democrats and Republicans. Accordingly, other explanations may be at play. One possibility highlights differences in the supply of news (Grinberg et al. 2019): Democrats and Republicans may be equally motivated by accuracy goals but Republicans end up sharing more falsehoods because their Twitter networks offer a greater supply of fake news sources to share from. Another -complementary -supply-side explanation shifts the focus from accuracy-to goal-oriented motivations: Democrats and Republicans are equally motivated to share information that is useful for furthering their political agenda but the supply of useful real news stories is lower for Republicans, propelling them to turn to fake news sites for material. The sentiment analyses of news headlines are consistent with this explanation. Only *pro*-Republican fake news sources were more negative towards Democrats than towards Republicans. This pattern was consistent across news stories shared by the panelists, both partisans and Independents (see SM section 11 for analyses of Independents), and the news stories from the news site front pages. This at least suggests that this asymmetry reflects a difference in the supply of content. A Republican scanning the Internet for materials to share must turn to fake news sources to find news that, on average, satisfy their partisan need to derogate Democrats. Democrats operating in the same manner, in contrast, can stop their search at posts linking to *pro*-Democratic real news websites or even centrist websites. Without individual-level data on news exposure, it is very difficult to tease apart these explanations (see Eady et al. (2019)) and, most likely, all are at play. Still, if the latter explanations are at least partly correct, the partisan asymmetry in fake news sharing may have less to do with psychological differences between Democrats and Republicans and more to do with differences in the supply of useful information (in a partisan sense). This would dovetail with studies demonstrating that Democrats and Republicans are equally motivated by partisan goals (Brandt et al. 2014). Also, we want to note that it is unclear whether a supply-oriented explanation is evidence of actual media bias. Bias is notoriously difficult to establish. Some prior studies have found similar evidence of a liberal bias in legacy media (Groseclose and Milyo 2005), but the general negative coverage of leading Republicans could also reflect a \"bias in reality\" (Groeling 2013) during an unusual period in US politics. Overall, these conclusions have important implications for how to intervene successfully against the circulation of \"fake news.\" If people care primarily about a story's ability to hurt political enemies, we should not be surprised if fact-checking fails to reduce sharing. In fact, our findings suggest that offline realities shape online sharing of \"fake news.\" Fake news sharing relates to the increasingly polarized political debates in the United States, and it may be difficult to fix the problem of fake news without fixing the larger problem of political polarization. Unfortunately, this is much harder to accomplish than adding automatic factchecks on social media platforms. This does not imply that it is impossible to demotivate sharing of \"fake news.\" Evidence is emerging that fake news sharing decreases other people's trust in the sharer (Altay, Hacquin and Mercier 2019). Reputational concerns may explain the low prevalence of fake news. This implies that successful interventions could work by reminding people to \"not make a fool of themselves\" when they are about to share information from non-credible sources. Yet, even if such interventions can drive down sharing of genuine fake news (Pennycook et al. 2019), the underlying problem remains. Polarized partisans can often find plenty of negative content on ordinary news sites. While each individual news story may be true, the overall picture painted by exclusively sharing derogatory news stories may not be. In this perspective, the real problem is the tendency to selectively engage with derogatory news",

        "section": "There has been considerable recent interest in how people make judgments of contingency or covariation between factors (e.g., see Alloy & Tabachnik, 1984;Arkes & Harkness, 1983;Crocker, 1981;Nisbett & Ross, 1980;Schustack & Steinberg, 1981;Shaklee & Mims, 1982), and one often-studied class of contingency tasks is readily described by the theoretical framework proposed in the present paper. These are tasks that require the subject to estimate the degree of contingency (or its presence or absence) between two dichotomous variables, on the basis of the presentation of a number of specific instances. For example, Ward and Jenkins (1965) presented subjects with the task of determining whether there was a contingency between the seeding of clouds and the occurrence of rainfall on that day. Subjects based their judgments on a series of slides, each of which indicated the state of affairs on a different day: (a) seeding + rain, (b) seeding + no rain, (c) no seeding + rain, or (d) no seeding + no rain. In our terms, the dichotomous-contingency task can be characterized as follows: The subject is presented with a target property or event and a set of conditions that are hypothesized to distinguish occurrences of the target from nonoccurrences. In the Ward and Jenkins (1965) example, the target event is rain, and the condition of having seeded the clouds is hypothesized to distinguish rainy from nonrainy days. This task is different from rule discovery in two ways. First, the hypothesized rule is not compared to a standard of \"best possible\" prediction, but rather to a standard of \"better than nothing.\" Second, the information search takes place in memory; the tester determines which information to attend to or keep track of rather than controlling its presentation. (A similar characterization is presented by Crocker, 1981.) Despite these differences, we propose that the basic +test strategy is manifested in covariation judgment much as it is in other, more external tasks. The event types listed above can be mapped onto our division of instances into H and H, T and T (see Table 3). The labels given the cells, A, B, C, and D, correspond to the terminology commonly used in studies of contingency. One possible evaluation strategy in such a problem is to think of cases in which the conditions were met (days with cloud seeding), and estimate how often those cases possessed the target property (rain). This is +Htesting: examining instances that Similarly, one could think of cases in which the target property occurred (it rained) to see whether the hypothesized conditions were met (clouds had been seeded). This is equivalent to +Ttesting, based on instances in cells A and C. We expect, as usual, that people will favor +Htests and +Ttests over -Htests and -Ttests. We also expect that there may be a tendency toward +Htesting in particular, because of greater attention to the sufficiency of rules than to their necessity (e.g., you do not mind if it rains sometimes without seeding). Also, many contingency tasks are framed in terms of the relation between causes and effects. Htests may be more natural then, because they are consistent with the temporal order of causation, moving from known causes to possible results (cf. Tversky & Kahneman, 1980). These hypotheses lead to some specific predictions about people's judgments of contingency. On a group level, judgments The data from a variety of studies support these predictions. Schustack and Sternberg (1981), for example, found that the contingency judgments of subjects taken as a group were best modeled as a linear combination of the number of instances of each of the four types, with the greatest emphasis placed on Acell, B-cell, C-cell, and D-cell data, in that order. Similar results were reported in an experiment by Arkes and Harkness (1983, Experiment 7), and in a meta-analysis of contingency-judgment tasks by Lipe (1982). A number of studies have also examined data from individual subjects. Although some studies indicate that people are influenced almost entirely by A-cell data (Jenkins & Ward, 1965;Nisbett & Ross, 1980;Smedslund, 1963), there is now considerable evidence for the prevalence of an A -B strategy (Arkes & Harkness, 1983;Shaklee&Mims, 1981,1982;Ward & Jenkins, 1965). This label has been applied to strategies that compare the number of H n T instances with the number of H n T (Cell A vs. CeUB) as well as strategies that compare T n H (Cell A) with T n H {Cell Q. The first comparison is consistent with our idea of +Htesting, the second with +Ttesting. These two kinds of comparison have not been clearly distinguished in the literature. For example, Arkesand Harkness (1983) sometimes label the condition-but-no-event cell as B, and sometimes the eventhut-no-condition cell as B. However, in one study, Shaklee and Mims (! 981) were able to distinguish A -B and A -C patterns in their data and found evidence of both. Further evidence of a +test approach is found in a recent study by Doherty and Falgout (1985). They presented the Ward and Jenkins (1965) cloud-seeding task on a computer screen and enabled subjects to save instances in computer memory for later reference. Although there were large individual differences, the most common pattern was to save a record of instances in cells A and B (the results of +Htests). The second most common pattern was to save A-, B-, and C-ceB instances (+Htests and +Ttests), and the third most common pattern was B and C (the falsifications from +Htests and +Ttests). Together, these 3 patterns accounted for 32 of 40 data-saving patterns in two experiments. In contingency judgment as in rule discovery, the +test strategy can often work well as a heuristic for hypothesis testing. However, this approach can deviate appreciably from statistical standards under some circumstances. Most statistical indexes (e.g., chi-square or correlation coefficient) put equal weight on all four cells, which -f testing does not Are people capable of more sophisticated strategies? Shaklee andMims (1981,1982) and Arkes and Harkness (1983) describe a sum-of-diagonals strategy that generally fares well as a rough estimate of statistical contingency. However, a simple combination of+Htests and +Ttests would result in a pattern of judgments very similar to the sum-of-diagonals strategy. A stimulus set could be carefully constructed to discriminate the two, but in the absence of such studies, we suspect that many sum-of-diagonals subjects may actually be using a combination of A versus B (+Htests) and A versus C (+Ttests). This may explain why individual analyses indicate frequent use of sum-of-diagonals strategies whereas group analyses often indicate that D-cell data is given little weight. On the other hand, we would expect that subjects might use more sophisticated strategies under favorable circumstances. There is some evidence that reduced memory demands have such an effect. Contingency judgments are more sophisticated when data are presented in summary form, rather than case by case (Arkes & Harkness, 1983;Shaklee & Mims, 1981, 1982;Shaklee & Tucko;1980;Ward & Jenkins, 1965). Also, the problem context and the wording of the question may direct attention to relevant sources of data (Arkes & Harkness, 1983;Crockei;1982;Einhorn& Hogarth, 1986).",
