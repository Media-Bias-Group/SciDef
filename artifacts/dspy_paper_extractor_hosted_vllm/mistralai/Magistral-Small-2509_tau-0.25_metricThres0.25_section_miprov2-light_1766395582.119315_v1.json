        "section": "According the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), food insecurity \"is defined as a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food\". 1 Recent data indicate that approximately 12.3% or 15.6 million households in the United States (U.S.) were food insecure at least some time during the last year. 1 The adverse social, physical, and psychological outcomes associated with food insecurity are well documented, particularly in households with children including higher rates of diabetes and hypertension, self-reported fair or poor health, maternal depression, behavioral problems/developmental delays in early life, and poor academic achievement. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8] These outcomes are not only detrimental to the health and well-being of individual children and families but also negatively impact broader society. Based on a combination of lower worker productivity, higher costs of public education, greater health care costs, and the cost associated with emergency food distribution, the economic burden associated with food insecurity has been estimated to be over $167.5 billion annually. 9 For over 20 years, food insecurity has been assessed and monitored by the USDA at the federal level. Although levels of food insecurity have declined and risen over this period, one trend that has continued to persist is the gap in the prevalence of food insecurity between people of color and whites. 1 An analysis examining trends in food insecurity from 2001 to 2016 found that food insecurity rates for both non-Hispanic black and Hispanic households were at least twice that of non-Hispanic white households (See Figure 1). 1 Moreover, while race/ethnic specific rates from the USDA are not available for all subgroups, other studies assessing food insecurity among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) report similar results. 10,11 Using the Current Population Survey-Food Security Supplement, Jernigan et al., 2017 found that from 2000 to 2010, 25% of AI/ANs remained consistently food insecure and AI/ANs were twice as likely to be food insecure compared to whites. 12 The relationship between race/ethnicity and food insecurity is complex and is clearly intertwined with other established determinants of food insecurity including poverty, unemployment, incarceration, and disability. Concentration of social and economic disadvantage among people of color over the life course is clearly a significant driver of higher rates of food insecurity. Substantial gaps in the wealth of people of color and whites have long existed in the U.S. For example, recent data reported by the Pew Research Center indicate that the wealth of white households was 13 times the median wealth of black and 10 times greater than Hispanic households. 13 Nevertheless, despite the intersectionality of race/ ethnicity and other social/economic determinants, some evidence suggests that the higher risk of food insecurity among people of color continue even when these other social and economic factors are removed.

          "Humanity and societies today face challenges to sustainability, which fundamentally relates to the ability to sustain humanity, civilizations and ecosystems on Earth. These challenges are expected to become more significant in the future. Achieving sustainability is therefore one of the most important objectives of a society and its people. The issues and concerns embodied by sustainability are broad and numerous. They cover such diverse issues as resource supply (water, energy, mineral, food), climate change and pollution, management of wastes (toxic, hazardous, radioactive, convention- ISSN 2283-7949 GLOCALISM: JOURNAL OF CULTURE, POLITICS AND INNOVATION 2018, 3, DOI: 10.12893/gjcpi.2018.3.4 Published online by \"Globus et Locus\" at www.glocalismjournal.net  al), sanitation, land use and desertification, species extinction and loss of biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, water quality and drought, industrial development, production and consumption patterns, population growth, urbanization, globalization, cultural and social sustainability, natural and anthropogenic disasters, peace and stability and government policies. The breadth of topics related to sustainability suggests that a holistic and comprehensive approach to sustainability is necessary. Sustainability activities are increasingly becoming part of the agendas and operating plans of governments and businesses. The elements of sustainability need to be connected if activities are to attain sustainability goals. In the remainder of this chapter, the historical context for sustainability is briefly described, sustainability concepts and definitions are reviewed, and sustainability is discussed, focusing on its economic, environmental and social dimensions as well as issues and concerns. The related concept of sustainable development is examined. Then, assessment measures for sustainability are considered, and some sustainability applications are presented.",
          "The challenge of achieving sustainability for societies is not limited to the present day, even though the global nature of the problem has come to the fore in recent decades. Sustainability was an objective, at least implicitly, for early civilizations. Since humans transitioned from mobile hunter-gatherers to agriculture and settlements approximately 12,000 years ago during the Neolithic age, in what has come to be known as the agricultural revolution, the sustainability of the lifestyle was crucial in determining if society would thrive or collapse. The decline of the Western Roman Empire constitutes another noteworthy historical illustration of a society that failed to sustain itself and ultimately collapsed. Waning returns from natural resource production as well as social factors contributed to the decline (Tainter 1998). The multidimensional nature of sustainability became more evident in more recent history, especially with concerns over environmental degradation. ISSN 2283-7949 GLOCALISM: JOURNAL OF CULTURE, POLITICS AND INNOVATION 2018, 3, DOI: 10.12893/gjcpi.2018.3.4 Published online by \"Globus et Locus\" at www.glocalismjournal.net  The case of the Polynesians on Easter Island, located in the Pacific Ocean, provides an important historical illustration of how unsustainable practices and lifestyles can contribute or lead to societal collapse. The inhabitants of Easter Island exhausted the resources of their remote habitat to such an extent that they could no longer feed themselves or even build canoes to escape. The ecological damage to Easter Island led to a total societal collapse that decimated its population compared to its peak in the 1600s (Graedel, Allenby 2010).",
          "Numerous definitions of sustainability exist, but none apply for all circumstances. Making sustainability operational rather than vague and theoretical is a challenge, which is made all the more daunting due to the numerous definitions of sustainability. In theory, sustainability can be defined as \"enduring in perpetuity\". However, such a definition is neither practical nor useful. Little if anything can be sustained forever, while much can be sustained over the very short term. A timescale of 50 to 100 years, representing two to four generations, is often viewed as more practical. A simple definition sustainability was stated by Ehrenfeld, who defined sustainability as \"the possibility that human and other forms of life will flourish on the planet forever\". Although this definition incorporates environmental and societal aspects, the timescale is impractical. Taking a more technical perspective, sustainability can be defined in terms of carrying capacity, which indicates the maximum number of people that can be supported in a given area, accounting for availability of resources and the ability of the environment to accept waste emissions. The carrying capacity for a region is in particular dependent on the demand and supply of natural resources. But sustainability encompasses more than technical factors and cannot be defined from an environmental perspective exclusively. Rather, sustainability is often conceptually defined as having three dimensions: environmental, economic and social. An important feature of this approach is the extension of sustainability beyond carrying capacity to include economic and social fac- tors. A multidimensional view of sustainability is consistent with the understanding of how several factors affect whether societies thrive or decline. But these three dimensions are often in tension (e.g., environmental and social sustainability may be achieved to the detriment of economic sustainability). Achieving a sustainable balance is challenging. Sustainability, and its three main dimensions, can be conceptually illustrated in various ways: a) Sustainability can be viewed as founded or supported by three legs or pillars, representing environmental, economic and social sustainability (fig. 1). This is akin to a three-leg table that can only remain standing if environmental, economic and social sustainability dimensions are satisfied. This balance can prove challenging, since the sustainability dimensions are often in conflict; b) Sustainability can also can be thought of as the common point of overlap of three intersecting circles, where the three circles represent the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability (fig. 2); c) A variation on this representation displays sustainability using concentric circles (fig. 3). Economic sustainability, being an activity of people and occurring within communities, is seen to be a subset of social sustainability, which involves many social and cultural dimensions as well as economic factors. Then social sustainability is seen to be a subset of environmental sustainability, since activities of people and societies are carried out within the environment and thus threaten environmental sustainability; d) The three dimensions of sustainability can be also shown in a hierarchal structure, where the economy is a subsystem of society, and society is embedded in the environment (fig. 4). These illustrations are similar, but have subtle differences. All of the illustrations demonstrate the interconnected nature of the environment, the economy and society, and their relations to and effects on sustainability for any a system or process. The above points also demonstrate the truly multidisciplinary nature of sustainability, and its linkages to diverse fields such as science, engineering, environment, ecology, economics, business, sociology and philosophy. Addressing sustainability requires consideration of topics such as resource use (energy and material), economic development, social development, health, environmental stewardship, engineering, design and architecture. It also requires an understanding of how people in the different disciplines interact and relate in addressing these factors.     Sustainability concepts can be focused around a discipline when needed or useful. For example, consider sustainability in engineering, which constitutes the application of science and mathematics principles for practical purposes such as the design, manufacturing and operation of products and processes, while accounting for economic, environmental, sociological and other constraints. Engineering significantly affects economic development, standards of living, societal well-being, the environment and cultural development. Numerous factors need to be addressed in moving towards engineering sustainability (fig. 5), including appropriate selection of resources bearing in mind sustainability criteria, use of sustainable engineering processes, enhancement of efficiency of engineering processes and resource use, and holistic adoption of environmental stewardship in engineering activities. In moving towards engineering sustainability, other key sustainability measures also need to be addressed, such as economics, equity, land use, lifestyle, sociopolitical factors and population. The multidimensional nature of sustainability suggests that achieving it is a systems challenge. That is because the overall in- teraction between subsystems needs to be integrated to achieve a sustainable system or process. For clarity, the three main dimensions of sustainability are each examined below.",
          "The economy and society are subsystems of the environment, which is the source and sink of all material and energy interactions on Earth. The sustainability of humanity implies ensuring an ability of the Earth to support human and activities related to it. Human economies and populations have grown such that anthropogenic activities now have global and long-term impacts, with various consequences. These can degrade the ability of the planet to support life. Many environmental issues affect sustainability. The loss of biodiversity throughout the world, due to economic development and other factors, and threatens the sustainability. Deforestation and development often lead to the destruction of natural habitats and cause the migration of animals to suitable environs. The extraction or use of limited resources and the release into the environment of emissions and wastes to the air, water and land also put sustainability at risk (Aghbashlo, Rosen 2018). Air pollutants released by internal combustion engines in vehicles, fossil fuel-fired electrical power plants and various industrial activities can adversely affect air quality and the health of humans and other living species. Industrial liquid emissions, including wastewater, and runoff from agricultural activity can lead to environmental problems, e.g., bioaccumulation of toxic compounds in the cells of aquatic animals, and eutrophication of water bodies. Two of the most significant challenges regarding environmental sustainability follow: Climate change. Stabilizing the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, in order to prevent the harmful effects of global warming and climate change, constitutes according to most studies one of today's most significant challenges. In the atmosphere, GHGs absorb infrared radiation emitted at the surface of the Earth. This leads to a greenhouse effect and the associated planetary warming. The primary GHG is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), but there are others such as methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The main anthropogenic sources of GHG emissions include fossil fuel combustion, agricultural nitrogen utilization, and enteric fermentation in ruminant animals. Global warming and the risks of climate destabilization are exacerbated by positive feedback effects, such as increased solar radiation absorption from the loss of reflecting surfaces like ice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has since 1990 published comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science and predictions about future trends. The fifth assessment report, finalized in 2014, reports warming trends due to anthropogenic activities as \"very likely\". As climate models become more sophisticated, the predicted amount of warming has increased, as have the related climate and other impacts. Much effort globally and at the United Nations is focused on achieving international agreements or treaties to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that avoids dangerous anthropogenic climate change (e.g. Berthiaume, Rosen 2017). Stratospheric ozone depletion. The layer of ozone (O 3 ) in the stratosphere reduces the transmission of solar radiation to the surface of the Earth. This stratospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, particularly UV-B, which can harm animals and plants. Declines in ozone levels in the stratosphere, especially over polar regions, were observed since the late 1970s. The main ozone depleting substances are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used for decades as refrigerants, which participate in ozone-destroying chemical reactions in the stratosphere. A phase out of CFCs was agreed to in 1989 via the Montreal Protocol, but they are still used in low-income countries. The long residence times of CFCs in the atmosphere implies that the reduced ozone layer concentrations will persist for many decades.",
          "An economy that provides good living standards, the services that people require and jobs is necessary for sustainability in society. A sustainable society requires long-term economic development rather than just economic growth. This latter, often meas- ured as growth in gross domestic product, is what occurs today, where capitalist economies depend on economic growth to generate wealth and jobs. Since the economy operates within a planet having finite resources and capacities (Aghbashlo, Rosen 2018), a continually growing economy is not necessarily sustainable over the long term. Eventually, therefore, the global economy needs to operate more in a steady-state manner, with little or zero growth. The best options for economic sustainability may vary from country to country. For instance, Daly (1990) suggests that wealthy countries need to develop instead of grow their economies in order to conserve resources and waste-assimilation capacities, and that poor countries benefit more from economic growth. Sometimes, economic sustainability arguments are divided into strong and weak sustainability categories: Strong sustainability. This view of sustainability is based on natural capital (the planet's stock of natural resources, including air, water, geology, soils and all living organisms) providing ecosystem services that are not substitutable with human capital (the stock of knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, creativity, and labor). Environmentalists and natural scientists often prefer this viewpoint of sustainability, seeing natural and human capital as complementary, but not interchangeable. Weak sustainability. This view of sustainability is based on the concept of a constant total capital stock, which is the sum of human and natural capital, and allows for human capital to substitute for natural capital. Economists often favor this view of sustainability, which permits natural resources to decline provided there is an increase in human capital, including know-how and knowledge. The difference between these two views of economic sustainability mainly focuses on the substitutability of human for natural capital. What constitutes societal sustainability may change temporally. For instance, people in the future may inhabit smaller houses, live in higher density neighborhoods, possess less material goods and travel less. Even if this leads to a lower gross domestic product per capita in the future, it may lead to a higher quality of life. Two major factors in societal sustainability follow: Equity. The concept of societal sustainability includes equity within and between generations. Intragenerational equity speaks to equity between people of the same generation, and requires more balanced distribution of wealth. This may necessitate shifts in resources between rich and poor nations and within them. Intergenerational equity focuses on equity between present and future generations, so as to ensure that future generations have are able to a attain a reasonably good quality of life compared to preceding generations. Intergenerational equity spanning two to four generations into the future, roughly equivalent to 50 to 100 years, is often envisioned as a necessary factor for societal sustainability. Health. Human health and well-being is an important factor social sustainability. Important measures of human health include life expectancy and infant mortality (Smil 2007). Many factors contribute to human health, including access to healthy and clean food and drinking water, safe waste disposal, and an environment without harmful substances that can lead to chronic or acute diseases (e.g. toxins and carcinogens). SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT To be developed: people (e.g., life expectancy, quality of life, education, equity), society (e.g., security, institutions) and the economy (e.g. wealth creation, jobs). Social and economic systems of people can be enhanced through development. For instance, the quality of life of people in developing countries can be improved through more equitable distribution of wealth, better education, and less reliance on non-renewable resources, leading to a more equitable society; b) To be developed: people (e.g., life expectancy, quality of life, education, equity), society (e.g., security, institutions) and the economy (e.g. wealth creation, jobs). Social and economic systems of people can be enhanced through development. For instance, the quality of life of people in developing countries can be improved through more equitable distribution of wealth, better education, and less reliance on non-renewable resources, leading to a more equitable society; c) To be sustained: life support systems (e.g. resources, land, soil, water, air), nature (e.g. ecosystems, habitats, biodiversity) and communities (e.g. cultures). Earth and its ecosystems provide ecosystem services (e.g. climate stability, water and air purification) and natural resources. These permit human communities to endure into the future and thrive. Thus, to sustain the services provided by nature that people have adapted to and depend upon, the Earth and its life-support systems need to be sustained. Ensuring that sustainable development is incorporated pervasively and comprehensively into industry, government, planners and people's lives is of great importance. Policies and strategies for sustainable development are needed that are sound, coordinated, meaningful realistic and achievable.  Tab 1.

Sustainability is a state that can be maintained into the future. But, since development means \"bringing gradually to an improved state\", sustainable development implies a course of action that improves the quality of life of people and societies, and that can endure into the future.",
          "The assessment of sustainability is important for making sustainability operational and measuring and monitoring progress towards sustainability. But assessing sustainability is challenging, since no universally accepted method exists for the task. There are many reasons for this, including the difficulty in measuring the main dimensions of sustainability (Hacatoglu et al. 2016). For example, although emissions of GHGs and ozone depleting substances are measurable, quantifying their economic and social impacts is challenging. Also, despite standard of living often being measured as gross domestic product per capita, quality of life can be a more significant measure of human well-being and satisfaction. Sustainability assessment can also be contentious (Morse, Fraser 2005). Nonetheless, various methods for assessing or measuring sustainability have been developed. Some examples: a) Some assessment methods utilize sustainability indicators, which are typically simple quantitative proxies that measure economic, social, and environmental factors. Some indicators are integrated, combining various dimensions of the environment, the economy and society, while others are not integrated, measuring only a single aspect of sustainability; b) Some sustainability indexes have been developed based on an aggregate or composite of selected sustainability indicators. A single-value measure of sustainability based on an aggregate index is beneficial for understanding and communication, due to its simplicity. But the determination of such indicators necessitates normalization, weighting and aggregation of data. These steps usually lead to a loss of useful information and can be challenging in their own right. A single-value sustainability measure can mask details associated with the multidimensional nature of sustainability and thus be misleading. Nonetheless, aggregate sustainability indexes are often preferred by policy makers in industry and government since they can be more easily interpreted and communicated to stakeholders or the public than multiple sustainability values; c) Daly (1990) developed operational principles for sustainable development. Although useful, these are limited to quasi-sustainable use of non-renewable resources and the use of renewable resources. Few if any sustainability assessment methods consider the environment, the economy and society together. Rather, many assessment methodologies focus on only one dimension of sustainability (e.g. economic development or environmental sustainability). Several examples are considered to illustrate this. First, biophysical assessment approaches are suited to assessing environmental sustainability, by quantifying resource use and environmental impact. But they are normally inadequate for addressing societal and economic facets of sustainability. Second, monetary values can be applied to social and environmental capital to assess sustainability. However, financial valuations for non-market goods and services are not well developed, improper valuations, and difficult due to our limited understanding of ecosystems and the services they provide. Third, the Environmental Sustainability Index ranks countries based on an aggregate of several environmental indicators. But these are usually unable to correlate environmental sustainability and economic growth. A weakness of many existing methods of assessing sustainability is their lack of a systems approach, which regards the system being considered as a whole and accounts for the interactions among its subsystems. This is important because achieving a more sustainable society is a systems problem, where the environment, the economy and society are all interdependent. Coupled humanenvironmental systems have interactions among different systems that lead to trade-offs, e.g. reducing costs may cause a process to have higher emissions or lower efficiency. A non-systems approach focusing on single factors can usually be seen to be inadequate for assessing sustainability holistically. As noted earlier, for example, biophysical approaches focus mainly on environmental sustainability and neglect economic and social dimensions, while methods based on weak sustainability focus on economic factors and neglect the biophysical facets of sustainability. Clearly, the sustainability of a system needs to be assessed with a systems approach. Life cycle analysis is usually part of such an approach, as it identifies material and energy inputs and outputs of a system or process and uses this information to assess environmental, economic and social effects. Although there are environmental concerns regarding the project, it nonetheless is viewed as providing significant environmental benefits. The Red-Mediterranean-Dead Seas Canal project has been shown to be the type of large project that may contribute significantly to sustainability. The benefits, which in many ways drive its contribution to numerous facets of sustainability, are shown in fig. 8. Surveys also indicate examples of common applications of sustainability, and these typically show that there is a strong focus on the implementation of sustainability concepts, actions, by both individuals and corporations. For example, the present author recently examined the actions of engineering practitioners regarding sustainability (Rosen 2013). Some specific findings were that the main sustainable technology priorities are using less energy and natural resources, reducing emissions and material wastes, and utilizing renewable, recyclable and recycled materials, and that challenges to sustainability exist, like economics viability. A breakdown of the degree of involvement of engineers with   sustainability or sustainable technologies showed that more than two-thirds of engineers are involved to some degree in sustainability, usually by working on sustainable products and processes. Also, the factors most likely to influence an organization's use of green design practices and procedures are regulatory requirements, client demand and rising energy costs (fig. 9).",
          "Although sometimes vague and often complex, sustainability is an important aim for societies and humanity. Sustainability is a multidimensional concept, encompassing economic, social, environmental and other factors. Sustainability assessment tools are needed to evaluate processes and systems, and how changes affect their sustainability. This usually necessitates a comprehensive set of indicators of the sustainability of the environment, the economy, technology, society, and institutional systems. Many human civilizations in the past proved to be unsustainable to some degree. It is hoped that the coverage provided in this chapter, including sustainability definitions and historical contexts, its economic, environmental and social dimensions, sustainable development, sustainability assessment measures and relevant applications, will assist efforts to address sustainability challenges today and, as an even more important priority, in the future.

Over the past 15-20 years, however, a new discourse on social factors and health-with wider relevance to the general population-has emerged in the United States, building on earlier work in Europe and Canada. Figure 1 illustrates the rapidly growing literature on the social (including economic) determinants of health (SDOH) in the United States and elsewhere. The concept is becoming far less marginal in the U.S. public health realm in general, not only in academia; the SDOH have received increasing attention from public health and nonprofit agencies (21,29,88,90,113).

Source: Results of a PubMed search for \"social determinants.\" Literature related to health outcomes, indicators, or promotion was included; health-care literature was not included. States and other countries (1, 10, 123) has led to increased understanding of how social factors influence health and has enhanced the scientific credibility of relevant efforts. Notable recent initiatives include the World Health Organization (WHO) Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (122), the MacArthur Foundation Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health (111), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission to Build a Healthier America (91). Incremental improvements in health with increasing social advantage have now been observed in the United States (14) as well as in Europe (69,92), indicating the relevance of SDOH for middle-class as well as the most disadvantaged Americans. Systematic efforts have disseminated this knowledge and made it compelling for broader U.S. audiences (17,91). An increasing focus among U.S. researchers, health agencies, and advocates on the concept of health equity has also contributed, encompassing the spectrum of causesincluding social determinants-of racial/ ethnic and other social disparities in health that raise concerns about justice (8, 15, 79,88,113). Finally, U.S. public health leaders and researchers have increasingly recognized that the dramatic health problems we face cannot be successfully addressed by medical care alone. The low U.S. ranking on key health indicators internationally has continued to fall as our medical expenditures skyrocket, far outstripping those of healthier nations.",
          "The term social determinant of health is often used to refer broadly to any nonmedical factors influencing health, including health-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors (such as smoking). These factors, however, represent only the most downstream determinants in the causal pathways influencing health; they are shaped by more upstream determinants. To illustrate the upstream/downstream metaphor, consider people living near a river who become ill from drinking water contaminated by toxic chemicals originating from a factory located upstream. Although drinking the contaminated water is the most proximate or downstream cause of illness, the more fundamental (yet potentially less evident, given its temporal and physical distance from those affected) cause is the upstream dumping of chemicals. A downstream remedy might recommend that individuals buy filters to treat the contaminated water before drinking; because more affluent individuals could better afford the filters or bottled water, socioeconomic disparities in illness would be expected. The upstream solution, focused on the source of contamination, would end the factory's dumping. Although these concepts may make intuitive sense, the causal pathways linking upstream determinants with downstream determinants, and ultimately with health, are typically long and complex, often involving multiple intervening and potentially interacting factors along the way. This complexity generally makes it easier to studyand address-downstream determinants, at the risk of failing to address fundamental causes. This article focuses on the more upstream social determinants of health-the factors that play a more fundamental causal role and represent the most important opportunities for improving health and reducing health disparities. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual framework for the RWJF Commission's work. Although the relationships are more complex, this simplified schema highlights several important concepts. First, it shows that healthrelated behaviors and receipt of recommended medical care (key downstream determinants of an individual's health) do not occur in a vacuum. Rather, these factors are shaped by more upstream determinants related to the living and working conditions that can influence health both directly (e.g., through toxic exposures or stressful experiences) and indirectly (by shaping",

Researchers have observed stepwise socioeconomic gradients in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, for 30 years (69, 92) and more recently in the United States (14,73,82). As seen in Figure 3, using U.S. data, overall and in multiple racial/ethnic groups, the improvements in health with increasing social advantage-measured here by income-generally follow a stepwise, incremental gradient pattern: Although the most disadvantaged-those with belowpoverty-level incomes or without high-school completion-typically experience the worst health, even those with intermediate income or education levels appear less healthy than the most affluent/educated (14). The social gradients in health provide clues to understanding the SDOH. Although other research is needed to clarify the underlying pathways, the dose-response relationship suggested by the gradient patterns supports the biological plausibility of a fundamental causal role for one or more upstream SDOH. Gradients by income, education, or occupational grade could reflect relatively direct health benefits of having more economic resources (e.g., healthier nutrition, housing, or neighborhood conditions, or less stress due to more resources to cope with daily challenges), unmeasured socioeconomic factors, and/or associated psychosocial/ behavioral factors, such as health-related behaviors (109), self-perceived social status (121), or perceived control (68). Reverse causation as an alternative explanation is discussed below.  ",
          "Following the framework depicted in Figure 2, we briefly review current knowledge of how several important upstream social factors influence health.",
          "Neighborhoods can influence health through their physical characteristics, such as air and water quality and proximity to facilities that produce or store hazardous substances; exposures to lead paint, mold, dust, or pest infestation in housing; access to nutritious foods and safe places to exercise; or risk of pedestrian accidents (6, 23,48,49,51,77,97). The availability and quality of neighborhood servicesincluding schools, transportation, medical care, and employment resources-can also influence health, e.g., by shaping residents' opportunities to earn a living (43,83,117). Neighborhoods' physical and service characteristics can create and reinforce socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health. Health is also shaped by social relationships. For example, neighborhoods where residents express mutual trust and are willing to intervene for the public good have been linked with lower homicide rates (76, 98); conversely, less closely knit neighborhoods and more social disorder have been related to anxiety and depression (32,84,94). Many-but not all-studies have found that neighborhood features are associated with health even after considering residents' individual-level characteristics (37). Surprisingly, some researchers-albeit not manyhave found poorer health among disadvantaged individuals living in relatively advantaged neighborhoods (85,89,120), possibly because of adverse psychological effects of feeling worse off than one's neighbors and/or stronger social ties or reduced exposure to discrimination associated with a greater geographic concentration of one's own group (119). Working conditions and health. The physical aspects of work-the traditional domain of occupational health and safety-represent an obvious pathway through which work influences health. For example, jobs requiring repetitive movements and/or high physical workload put workers at higher risk for musculoskeletal injuries and disorders (81), whereas physically inactive workers in sedentary jobs are at increased risk of obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (115); physical conditions in the workplace such as inadequate ventilation, high noise levels, and hazardous chemical exposures can also harm health. Psychosocial aspects of work represent another pathway to health. For example, working overtime has been associated with injury, illness, and mortality (20). Workers in jobs characterized by high demands coupled with low control or by perceived imbalance of efforts and rewards are at higher risk of poor health (34,56); control at work may be a major contributor to socioeconomic differences in health among employed persons (56,68). Social support at work has also been linked with health (104-107); environments facilitating mutual support among coworkers may buffer against physical and mental health stressors (60). Work-related opportunities and resources can also influence health. Employment-related earnings represent most Americans' primary economic resource, shaping health-related decisions made for themselves and their families; work-related benefits-including medical insurance, paid leave, schedule flexibility, workplace wellness programs, child-and elder-care resources and retirement benefits-could also be important. Well-paying jobs are more likely to provide benefits, greater financial security, and ability to afford healthier living conditions. In contrast, the working poor-estimated at 7.4 million U.S. workers in 2006 (112)-generally do not earn enough to cover basic necessities and are less likely to have health-related benefits (27,54). Different pathways linking work and health may interact to exacerbate social disparities in health: Socially disadvantaged groups Multiple pathways linking education to health. are more likely to have health-harming physical and psychosocial working conditions, along with disadvantaged living conditions associated with lower pay (38). Education and health. Figure 4 depicts three interrelated pathways through which educational attainment (completed schooling) is linked with health. It is widely recognized that education can lead to improved health by increasing health knowledge and healthy behaviors. This may be explained in part by literacy, allowing more-educated individuals to make better-informed, healthrelated decisions-including about receipt and management of medical care-for themselves and their families (36,99). Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors (3) and earlier adoption of health-related recommendations (31). Education also plays an important role in health by shaping employment opportunities, which are major determinants of economic resources. More-educated individuals experience lower rates of unemployment, which is strongly associated with worse health and higher mortality (4); they are more likely to have jobs with healthier physical and psychosocial working conditions, better health-related benefits (44), and higher compensation (30) (which determines affordability of health-promoting living conditions). Education may also affect health by influencing social and psychological factors. More education has been associated with greater perceived personal control (74), which has frequently been linked with better health and health-related behaviors (63,74,75). Greater educational attainment is generally associated with higher relative social standing; subjective social status (an individual's perception of his or her ranking in a social hierarchy) may predict health even after controlling for more objective indicators of social status (35). More education also has been linked with increased social support (72), which is associated with better physical and mental health (5); social support may buffer the health-damaging effects of stress (110), influence health-related behaviors (24), and if one's social networks are socially advantaged, enhance access to employment, housing, and other opportunities and resources that can influence health (19). The role of educational quality-e.g., the employment opportunities, prestige, social networks, and other advantages accompanying a degree from an elite institution-is rarely considered in health studies. Educational attainment thus can underestimate health-related differences related to education (75,95). Income, wealth, and health. Economic resources reflect access to material goods and services, including income (monetary earnings during a specified time period) and wealth (accumulated material assets, such as the value of one's home, household possessions, vehicles and other property, bank accounts, and investments). Theoretically, wealth may better reflect economic resources overall, but it is more difficult to measure than income and hence less frequently measured in health studies. Among studies that have included both, many (but not all) have found links between wealth and health after considering income (87). Racial/ethnic differences in income markedly underestimate differences in wealth (13). Reverse causation (income loss due to poor health) occurs but does not fully account for the observed associations of income/wealth and health (58,78). Many longitudinal studies show that economic resources predict health or its proximate determinants, even after adjustment for education (2, 33, 52) [although education is a stronger predictor for other outcomes (52) and both are likely to matter (13, 58)]. Health effects of increasing income have been observed in randomized and natural experiments (58). Several researchers have observed health effects of income/wealth even after adjusting for many other relevant factors (33,58,62). Particularly when other socioeconomic factors are inadequately measured, however, observed associations between income/wealth and health may reflect effects of other socioeconomically linked factors such as educational attainment and quality, childhood socioeconomic circumstances, neighborhood characteristics, physical and psychosocial working conditions, and subjective social status. The health effects of low economic resources may be ameliorated by access to other resources and opportunities; for example, some relatively low-income countries/states (e.g., Cuba, Costa Rica, and Kerala, India) have favorable health indicators that may be explained by long-standing societal investments in education, social safety nets, and/or prevention-oriented medical care (41). Income inequality (measured at an aggregate level) has often been linked with health (116), although a causal link is debated (65,116). Income inequality could affect health by eroding social cohesion (59). The link could also be explained by other factors strongly associated with both income inequality and health, such as lack of social solidarity, which could be both a cause and an effect of income inequality. Race, racism, and health. In the United States and many other societies, race or ethnic group is another important social factor that influences health, primarily because of racism. Racism refers not only to overt, intentionally discriminatory actions and attitudes, but also to deep-seated societal structures that-even without intent to discriminate-systematically constrain some individuals' opportunities and resources on the basis of their race or ethnic group. Racial residential segregation is a key mechanism through which racism produces and perpetuates social disadvantage (22,117). Blacks and Latinos are more likely to reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods with inadequately resourced schools and hence to have lower educational attainment and quality Racial discrimination, racism: includes societal structures, such as residential segregation and social networks, that systematically perpetuate social disadvantage along racial or ethnic lines, even without conscious intent to discriminate (96), with resultant health effects through pathways discussed above. Racism may also affect health more directly through pathways involving stress; chronic stress related to experiences of racial/ethnic bias, including relatively subtle experiences arising even without consciously prejudicial intent, may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health, regardless of one's neighborhood, income, or education (80,118). More education or income may paradoxically expose blacks or Latinos to more discrimination because of more contact with (non-Latino) whites. Race-health links could also be shaped by perceptions of how one's race-and its associations with social influence, prestige, and acceptance-affects one's relative place in social hierarchies. Associations between discrimination and health similar to those observed in the United States are being found in other countries (118). The pervasive role of stress. Coping with daily challenges can be particularly stressful when one's financial and social resources are limited. Recent evidence implicates chronic stress in the causal pathways linking multiple upstream social determinants with health, through neuroendocrine, inflammatory, immune, and/or vascular mechanisms (71,108). Stressful experiences-such as those associated with social disadvantage, including economic hardship (12, 40) and racial discrimination (118)-may trigger the release of cortisol, cytokines, and other substances that can damage immune defenses, vital organs, and physiologic systems (71,101). This mechanism can lead to more rapid onset or progression of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease (108), and the bodily wear and tear associated with chronic stress may accelerate aging (70,102,103). The accumulated strain from trying, with inadequate resources, to cope with daily challenges may, over time, lead to more physiological damage than would a single dramatically stressful event (70). A recent collection of papers summarizes current knowledge of pathways and biological mechanisms likely to be involved in the health effects of stress and other psychosocial factorsincluding perceived control, subjective social status, and social support (1).",
          "The importance of early childhood experiences. Among the strongest bodies of SDOH evidence is work considering adverse health effects of early childhood experiences associated with family social disadvantage. Many studies have shown that early experiences affect children's cognitive, behavioral, and physical development (7, 25, 53, 55), which predicts health; developmental differences have been associated with socioeconomically linked differences in children's home environments, including differences in stimulation from parents/caregivers (7, 39,50,114,123). Biological changes due to adverse socioeconomic conditions in infancy and toddler years appear to become \"embedded\" in children's bodies, determining their developmental capacity (53). Several longitudinal studies following children from early childhood through young adulthood have linked childhood developmental outcomes with subsequent educational attainment (18,47,100), which is strongly associated with adult health (discussed above). Substantial evidence indicates that pathways initiated by childhood adversity can be interrupted. Studies show that high-quality early childhood development interventionsincluding center-based programs to nurture and stimulate children and to support and educate parents-greatly ameliorate the effects of social disadvantage on children's cognitive, emotional/behavioral, and physical development (57); the first five years of life appear to be most crucial (55), although opportunities for intervention continue throughout childhood (55) and adolescence (42). over lifetimes and across generations (9, 26,40,45,46,53,55,64,66,102,108,124). As illustrated in Figure 5, developed for the RWJF Commission, upstream social factors influence health at each life stage, with accumulating social advantage/disadvantage and health advantage/disadvantage over time. Children of socially disadvantaged parents are less healthy and have more limited educational opportunities, both of which diminish their chances for good health and social advantage in adulthood. Emerging research on geneenvironment interactions suggests that the intergenerational transmission of social advantage and health may be partially explained by epigenetic changes in gene expression, which in turn are passed on to subsequent generations (61).",

          "A large body of evidence from observational research strongly and repeatedly links multiple upstream social (including economic) factors with a wide array of health outcomes, and understanding-albeit incomplete-of underlying pathways and biological mechanisms has been growing. With notable exceptions, however, we know little about effective ways to address social factors to improve health and reduce health disparities-about when, where, and how to intervene. The gaps in knowledge reflect several challenges. More often than not, the relationships between upstream social factors and health are complex and play out over long periods of time, involving multiple intermediate outcomes subject to effect modification by characteristics of people and settings along the causal chain. This complexity makes it difficult to learn about the specific pathways through which upstream social factors shape health and to identify priorities for intervention. Addressing the knowledge gaps is also complicated by our limited ability to measure upstream social factors. Current measures do not fully capture-or tease out the distinct effects of-relevant aspects of income, wealth, education, or occupational rank. For example, the observed effects of race/ethnicity on adult health after adjustment for available socioeconomic measures suggest a potential role for unmeasured social influences (13)e.g., childhood circumstances, neighborhood characteristics, accumulated wealth, racial discrimination. Development of better measures of these influences is in its infancy (13,37,80,118). Research funding is also an issue. Most U.S. research funding supports studies of single diseases rather than causal or contributory factors with effects that manifest across multiple diseases, putting SDOH research at a disadvantage. The health effects of upstream social factors-or interventions to address themmay not manifest for decades or generations; longitudinal studies are expensive and access to longitudinal databases is particularly limited in the United States (9). Conducting randomized trials, the gold standard for establishing effectiveness in health sciences, is particularly challenging for upstream interventions.",
          "Investment at this time would be particularly strategic in several areas. Research to improve the measurement of social factors is an important requisite for effective efforts in all of the following areas. Descriptive studies and monitoring. Ongoing descriptive research is needed to monitor changes over time both in the distributions of key upstream social factors (e.g., income, wealth, and education) across groups defined by race/ethnicity, geography, and gender, and in their associations with health outcomes in specific populations and settings. Interpreted in light of relevant policies, these findings can indicate the extent to which social and health disadvantage affects different groups and gauge progress toward improving health and reducing health disparities. Longitudinal research. We need more life-course research, including longitudinal studies to build public-use databases with comprehensive information on both social factors and health, collected over time frames long enough-ideally multiple generations-for health consequences of early childhood experiences to manifest. A more reasonable balance is needed between investments in studying adult disease and examining children's trajectories of health and social advantage across the life course. Connecting the dots: linking knowledge to elucidate pathways and assess interventions. Even robust longitudinal data are unlikely to provide sufficient information for tracing the effects of an upstream determinant (A) through relevant pathways to its ultimate health outcomes (Z), particularly if exposure to A occurs in childhood and outcome Z occurs much later. Attempting to document and quantify the effects of A on Z in a single study represents an important obstacle to understanding how social factors influence health-and how to intervene. Considering the potential for effect modification by characteristics of people and contexts at each step of multiple complex causal pathways, the consistency of existing findings linking upstream social determinants with distal health outcomes seems remarkable. To strengthen our understanding of how upstream social factors shape health, we need to connect the dots by building the knowledge base incrementally through linking a series of distinct studies (perhaps spanning multiple disciplines) that examine specific segments of the pathways connecting A to Z. For example, one study could test the effects of an upstream determinant on an intermediate outcome, which then could be the independent variable in subsequent studies of increasingly downstream intermediate outcomes; no single study would be expected to span all steps from A to Z. Once the links in the causal chain are documented, a similar incremental approach could be applied to study the effectiveness of interventions, e.g., testing the effects of an upstream intervention on an intermediate outcome with established links to health. This approach to advancing knowledge is not new: Medicine and public health often rely on evidence from studies of intermediate outcomes (e.g., obesity) with demonstrated links to other outcomes (e.g., diabetes or cardiovascular disease) (11). Although not definitive, the knowledge gained from connecting the dots can be compelling when confirmed in multiple studies; furthermore, policy makers must recognize that the limited generalizability of findings from randomized experiments introduces uncertainty as well (11).",
          "We need research to inform translation of existing knowledge about the SDOH into effective and efficient policies. Often, the rate-limiting step may not be insufficient knowledge of pathways but rather lack of solid evidence about what, specifically and concretely, works best in different settings to reduce social inequalities in health. For example, although we have convincing evidence that educational quality and attainment powerfully influence health through multiple pathways, lack of consensus about interventions is often invoked to justify inaction. Knowledge of pathways can point to promising or at least plausible approaches but generally cannot indicate which actions will be effective and efficient under different conditions; that knowledge can come only from well-designed intervention research, including both randomized experiments (when possible and appropriate) and nonrandomized studies with rigorous attention to comparability and bias. Intervention research often seeks to identify the magic bullet that will yield results on its own, a stand-alone intervention with independent effects after adjusting for other factors. This notion may be reasonable when considering surgery, but the complex pathways linking social disadvantage to health suggest that seeking a single magic bullet is unrealistic. Interventions with individuals may require simultaneous efforts with families and communities. Recognizing the expense and methodologic challenges, we need multifaceted approaches that operate simultaneously across domains to interrupt damaging (and activate favorable) pathways at multiple points at which the underlying differences in social advantage and the consequent health inequalities are produced, exacerbated, and perpetuated. Other issues must also be addressed. Research funding must be expanded beyond a focus on single diseases and/or biomedical factors exclusively. The time frame for evaluating program or policy effectiveness should be extended (11). Researchers must be trained in the concepts, measures, and methods needed both to study SDOH and their interactions with biomedical factors (e.g., gene-environment interactions) and to consider social factors in clinical and laboratory studies focused on other questions. Political barriers to translating knowledge to action. The field of SDOH is coming of age in many ways, with respect to increased attention within and beyond academia; documentation of strong and pervasive links between social and economic factors and health; and the accumulation of knowledge of pathways and biological mechanisms that provide a scientific foundation for appreciating the role of social factors in health. Although associations between social factors and health are no longer in question, we have much to learn, both about the underlying processes linking upstream social determinants and most health outcomes and about effective ways to intervene. Lack of evidence, however, is not always the major barrier to action. Often, the chief obstacle is lack of political will; particularly in the United States, our deeply embedded culture of individualism can impede actions that require a sense of social solidarity. For example, as noted in an Institute of Medicine report, \"whether early childhood programs can make a difference has been asked and answered in the affirmative innumerable times\"; the remaining questions are about the most effective and efficient interventions (55). Even after major business groups have advocated universal highquality preschool as essential for achieving a productive-i.e., healthy and educated-future workforce (16,28,86), this goal remains elusive. Descriptive, explanatory, and interventional research can play a supportive role in building consensus about the need for action by increasing public and policy-maker awareness of unacceptable conditions such as racial and socioeconomic disparities in health; by making the links between social factors and health meaningful and plausible to the public and policy makers; and by suggesting, testing, and helping to estimate the costs of promising science-based approaches. Information about the pathways and mechanisms through which social advantage influences health can provide an important counterweight to victim-blaming, which too often impedes policies focused on upstream social and economic factors. Based on current understanding of the role of stress in the links between multiple social factors and health outcomes, studies of pathways involving stressful circumstances and physiological responses to stress may yield knowledge needed to help achieve consensus for action. Research on the SDOH can provide practical guidance for policies and add meaning and credibility to ethical and economic arguments for the need to act, not only to ameliorate the adverse health consequences but also to reduce social disadvantage itself.",
          "1. A critical mass of knowledge related to the social determinants of health has accumulated in the United States and elsewhere, documenting associations, exploring pathways and biological mechanisms, and providing a previously unavailable scientific foundation for appreciating the fundamental role of social factors in health. 2. The questions are no longer about whether social factors are important influences on health, but rather about how social factors operate and how we can most effectively intervene to activate health-promoting pathways and interrupt health-damaging ones. 3. Too little attention has been given to the upstream social determinants of health, such as economic resources, education, and racial discrimination. Although most research has focused on the more easily studied and addressed downstream factors, these upstream determinants represent the fundamental causes in pathways that influence downstream factors and ultimately lead to health effects. 4. One barrier to expanding our understanding of how upstream social determinants influence health is a widespread expectation that a single research study can encompass an entire pathway from upstream factor to downstream health effects. Such studies are unlikely to be achieved, however, given the complex causal chains and long time periods involved. Rather, we should focus on advancing knowledge of pathways incrementally by linking results from studies of specific pathway segments. 5. More research on pathways and biological mechanisms is needed, but this will not necessarily yield sufficient information for identifying the most effective and efficient interventions. Well-designed studies of interventions are essential. 6. On the basis of experience and awareness of the complexity of pathways, isolated interventions focused on single discrete (upstream or downstream) social factors may not be effective. The challenge is to design and adequately study multidimensional interventions that address multiple factors simultaneously. 7. Lack of evidence is not always the major barrier to action on the social determinants of health. Particularly in the United States, the crucial obstacle is often lack of political will. A strategic research agenda on the social determinants of health should also address the factors that can enhance or impede political will to translate knowledge into effective action.",

          "The Power of Political Rhetoric RONALD R. KREBS University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA PATRICK THADDEUS JACKSON American University, Washington, DC, USA While scholars of International Relations and comparative politics have usually treated rhetoric as epiphenomenal, one strand of constructivism has recently returned rhetoric to the heart of political analysis, especially through the mechanism of persuasion. We too maintain that rhetoric is central to political processes and outcomes, but we argue that persuasion is theoretically and methodologically problematic. We aver that rhetoric's role may be more usefully conceptualized in the context of coercion, and we advance a stylized model that illustrates how rhetorical coercion operates, explains why it works, and identifies key scope conditions. We subsequently illustrate our model's relevance through a detailed examination of a 'hard' case. This article's agenda is twofold. First, it advises scholars in these fields to avoid focusing on unanswerable questions about actors' motives and to examine instead what actors say, in what contexts, and to what audiences. Second, it lays the groundwork for a 'coercive constructivism', complementing the liberal version so prevalent today. KEY WORDS ♦ coercion ♦ constructivism ♦ discourse ♦ Habermas ♦ Israel ♦ military service ♦ persuasion ♦ rhetoric Talk is often thought to belong to the realm of diplomacy, war to the realm of action. Yet, during the 2003 Iraq War, the Bush administration was nearly as preoccupied with how the combat was portrayed as with the combat itself. Its foreign policy team invariably spoke of coalition forces rather than American forces, the war to liberate Iraq rather than the invasion of Iraq, Saddam's death squads rather than Saddam's fedayeen. Rhetoric is central to politics, even when politics takes the form of war. Yet rhetoric is curiously not central to much scholarship in comparative politics and International Relations. Politics is typically marked by rhetorical competition, but our theoretical frameworks are generally hard-pressed to make sense of its dynamics and outcomes. Whereas the dominant materialist tradition treats rhetoric as epiphenomenal, we argue, following recent constructivist work, that the rhetorical interplay itself provides leverage in explaining outcomes. We are less comfortable, however, with the argument advanced by some constructivists that political actors deploy resonant rhetorical forms and thereby persuade their interlocutors of the correctness of their preferred course of action. Although persuasion undoubtedly does occur in the political arena, it is also rare. Moreover, such mechanisms rest on a strong specification of the subjective motivations of individuals and thus are methodologically intractable. Recent mainstream constructivist research has prompted a refreshing debate on and advanced our understanding of political deliberation and argumentation. By focusing on internalized norms as the driving forces of behavior and policy, however, such research has ultimately diverted attention from the dynamics of rhetoric. Persuasion does not exhaust the ways through which rhetoric might shape political contest. In particular, we would call attention to culturalist approaches that concentrate on observable rhetorical contests, on narrative and language games. Drawing on this tradition as well as the broad insights of the field of political communication, we propose a model of 'rhetorical coercion' as an alternative means of conceptualizing the place of rhetoric in politics. 1  Employing an expansive definition of rhetoric that includes all speech actswhether they are oral or written, whether they take place under conditions approximating Habermas' 'ideal speech situation' or not -we argue that rhetorical maneuver can prove critical to success in political contests even when one's opponents have not internalized the promoted values. While claimants may deploy arguments in the hope that they will eventually persuade, their more immediate task is, through skillful framing, to leave their opponents without access to the rhetorical materials needed to craft a socially sustainable rebuttal. Rhetorical coercion occurs when this strategy proves successful: when the claimant's opponents have been talked into a corner, compelled to endorse a stance they would otherwise reject. Most narrowly conceived, this article suggests and explores a language-focused mechanism of political influence complementing recent scholarship, but it also has a broader agenda. At the level of methodology, it calls on mainstream scholarship to avoid centering causal accounts on unanswerable questions about actors' true motives and to focus instead on what actors say, in what contexts, and to what audiences. At the level of substantive theory, it joins European Journal of International Relations 13(1) other recent work in returning rhetoric to the heart of political analysis. But rhetoric is often both the medium and the locus of political contest, and thus focusing on its role in the context of deliberation can take us only so far. Rhetoric matters, we argue, when human beings power as well as when they puzzle. This article represents a step away from constructivism with a liberal flavor, focused on the transformation of values, toward constructivism with coercive characteristics, focused on the exercise of power. This article proceeds in four main sections. First, we critically review existing approaches to rhetoric in empirical political science, examining in particular the limitations of (liberal or deliberative) constructivist approaches premised on persuasion. Second, we set forth our generalizable mechanism of rhetorical coercion and explicate both its logic and its limits. Third, we illustrate this mechanism's operation by exploring in detail a single 'hard' case: the relatively successful efforts of Druze Arabs in Israel to garner greater citizenship rights by framing them as the just deserts of their military sacrifice. This outcome is not entirely explicable without close attention to the dynamics of competing rhetorical claims, and our model of rhetorical coercion helps make sense of this puzzling and important case. Fourth, we briefly discuss the particular possibilities and limits of rhetorical coercion within international politics.",
          "Most scholars of international and comparative politics disparage rhetoric as epiphenomenal. The very phrase 'mere rhetoric' captures the view that what counts is not the language people use but the material power resources upon which they can draw. This perspective is shared by 'realist' (and especially rationalist) writers, and it accords with a well-established understanding of political power. Disenchanted with narrow materialist approaches, some have in recent years sought to harness the power of ideas. Many have invoked beliefs, ideas, and culture to supply inputs and to serve as coordination devices in games with multiple equilibria (Goldstein and Keohane, 1993;Laitin, 1998). Political psychologists have long argued that ideas influence how actors interpret evidence and sift through information (Jervis, 1976). Students of collective action have suggested that principled commitments can motivate participants and render them unusually insensitive to the costs of protest (Cohen, 1985). However, scholars with an ideational bent have typically relegated rhetoric to the margins. For 'idealists', words matter only insofar as they reflect actors' true beliefs, with private statements seen as more revealing than public pronouncements. Public rhetoric is of causal consequence only from the top down, as leaders of states and social movements deploy resonant language in an effort to mobilize support (Edelman, 1964;Snow et al., 1986;Snow and Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms Benford, 1988). While devotees of 'interests' and 'ideas' vigorously debate the relative causal power of their favored variables, scholars in both traditions have little use for public rhetorical contestation. But to treat rhetoric as epiphenomenal is to render much of politics puzzling and to do violence to politics as lived by its participants. Rhetoric is certainly a weapon of the weak, but those holding the reins of power can and must deploy it as well. The acquisition and maintenance of rule ultimately hinge as much on legitimacy as on physical coercion, and such legitimacy can be established only through rhetorical action (Weber, 1968). While political contestants unquestionably further their agenda by exploiting material resources, they generally at the same time 'frame' their political activity, explaining the purposes to which their material power is put (Gamson, 1992). Such contests among state leaders and societal activists should be at the center of the study of politics. Rationalists and political psychologists might both protest that they have done precisely this. Rationalist scholars have pointed out that talk is not always cheap. State leaders who renege on their public rhetorical commitments may bear substantial domestic and international costs, giving them incentives both to tell the truth and to strategically manipulate audience costs (Fearon, 1994;Sartori, 2002). Though important, this insight flattens rhetoric into a purely informational tool, a way of efficiently revealing whether one is a high-cost or low-cost actor. As such, it cannot shed light on the framing competitions that often lie at the heart of politics. Political psychologists working within the area of political communication have demonstrated that speakers who succeed in defining the relevant considerations can shape mass opinion and ultimately policy outcomes. 2 But nearly all framing experiments have abstracted far from reality in exposing subjects to just a single issue frame (Druckman, 2001). Even the exceptions have failed to interrogate fully the dynamics of framing. Recent studies have concluded that the framing effect disappears when targets are exposed to competing frames from equally credible sources and that targets then respond in accord with supposedly invariant preferences (Druckman, 2004;Sniderman and Theriault, 2004). By this account, the intense framing contests endemic to politics are peripheral in that their only effect (given the caveat of equal credibility) is to render frame competition inconsequential, and baffling in that actors continue to expend copious resources on their rhetorical efforts. Moreover, this research program has ironically diverted attention from rhetorical interplay and instead directed it towards attributes of the target (e.g. political knowledge, awareness, expertise) and the source (e.g. credibility, trustworthiness, expert status). Studies of 'message effects' are comparatively rare. 3 Our debt to the psychological literature on framing is clear, but we wish to bring rhetoric itself back into the heart of the analysis.",
          "Most approaches fail to accord public rhetoric per se causal status, but one major exception has been the vibrant constructivist literature in international and comparative politics (Checkel, 1998;Finnemore and Sikkink, 2001). A central problem for constructivists has been explaining how and why new norms emerge and why actors might obey norms despite contrary material pressures. 4 Among the universe of mechanisms through which political actors develop 'shared understandings', and arguably occupying pride of place, is persuasion: 'normative claims ', Finnemore (1996: 141) asserts, 'become powerful and prevail by being persuasive' (see also Payne, 2001;Johnston, 2001). The targets of persuasive rhetorical moves do not grudgingly comply, but rather sincerely internalize new beliefs and consequently adopt new identities and preferences. Through persuasion, 'agent action becomes social structure, ideas become norms, and the subjective becomes the intersubjective' (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998: 914). Through persuasive rhetoric, national and transnational social movements prompt not merely compliance with but consent to existing norms, and norm entrepreneurs need not resort to coercion to effect change. Persuasion -and public rhetoric as its medium -have emerged as the coins of the constructivist realm (see, among many others, Checkel, 2001;Crawford, 2002;Keck and Sikkink, 1998;Risse et al., 1999;Risse, 2000). Though sometimes only implicitly, these scholars have often drawn on Jürgen Habermas' logic of 'communicative action' to explain the power of rhetoric (Johnson, 1993;Lynch, 1999Lynch, , 2002;;Müller, 2001;Risse, 2000). 5  Habermas acknowledges that political actors often engage in narrowly goaldirected (teleological) action, but what makes his political vision distinctive is its affirmation of the possibility and prevalence of rational dialogue, of openminded deliberation in the quest for truth. Every legitimate use of language, Habermas argues, is premised on mutual understandings, on 'idealizations that transcend any particular language game', and these 'give rise to the perspective of an agreement that is open to criticism on the basis of validity claims' (Habermas, 1990: 199). For Habermas, politics (at least in its ideal form) is less about contest than consensus, less about powering than puzzling, and deliberative exchange consequently takes center stage (Habermas, 1984). Ideally, actors leave power and rank at the door, and they seek to persuade others and are themselves open to persuasion. Experimental studies of deliberation in fact conclude that the key to sustaining reflective discussion lies in the willingness of participants to keep an open mind (Barabas, 2004). We are very much in sympathy with this emphasis on public rhetorical interchange, but we are skeptical as to the utility of privileging persuasion as a causal mechanism. As Habermas himself recognizes, the unconstrained dialogue of 'communicative action' is not an empirically accurate portrait of politics, for power and rank are omnipresent in the political sphere. Actors do not leave their identities at the door when entering into dialogue, and they do not employ language unadulterated by earlier political contestation. Discourse is therefore always structured -and not by reason alone. Rules of exclusion and employment dictate what arguments can be proffered, under what conditions, and by whom (Foucault, 1972). Insofar as empirically oriented constructivists invoke 'communicative action' to explain real-world processes, it is fair to ask whether rational deliberation characterizes actual political debate. Only on the rare occasions when it does can Habermasian discourse ethics yield empirical insight into political contestation. It would, therefore, seem more helpful to adopt a theoretical framework that explicates the power of rhetoric even when politics is not truth-seeking and truth-generating, and a conception of rhetoric that includes all speech, no matter how interlaced with power relations. We are also skeptical that analysts can overcome the methodological hurdles standing in the way of demonstrating that persuasion has occurred. Such an explanation presumes that one can pin down the 'real motives' driving individual choice, so that one can distinguish beliefs sincerely embraced from those adopted for strategic or other reasons (Payne, 2001: 39-41). But conclusive proof of persuasion is elusive, for it requires unmediated access to people's minds (Wittgenstein, 1953: §150-5). Did Gorbachev accede to the reunification of Germany because he had been persuaded by the trump card of self-determination (Risse, 2000) or because he had calculated that the net costs of resisting the United States were prohibitive? Did Europeans abandon their overseas colonies because they had been persuaded that formal empire was illegitimate (Crawford, 2002) or because they had calculated that the net expected costs of retaining the colonies were excessive? It is impossible to say based on the available evidence, nor is it clear what evidence could even in principle clinch the case. 6 Relying on statements delivered in private settings does not escape the problem, since these articulations may be as strategic as their public counterparts (Scott, 1990). Many of these questions have received attention elsewhere. Scholars of transnational activism have drawn attention to the 'mobilization of shame', and they too have concluded that ways of framing claims cannot be fabricated out of whole cloth (Crawford, 2002;Price, 1998Price, , 2003;;Risse and Sikkink, 1999). Elements of William Riker's suggestive work on 'heresthetics ' (1996) are apropos, as is Frank Schimmelfenig's research on 'rhetorical action ' (2004). We seek to build on and systematize these important contributions, but we also depart from them. First, while many constructivists recognize that the targets of activist efforts may comply at first for strategic reasons, they claim that lasting normative change requires internalization. 7 This formulation is problematic because it relies on incompatible microfoundations in stage one (instrumental adaptation) and stage two (internalization). On methodological grounds, we prefer a mechanism of political influence highlighting strategic European Journal of International Relations 13(1) action throughout the entire episode. We agree with Weber that consistency, not completeness, should be the hallmark of sound work in the social sciences (Weber, 1949). Further, we are reluctant to characterize any normative change as 'lasting' in the sense of forestalling normative contestation over the long run. We proceed from the premise that norms are inherently subject to challenge and that the rhetorical arrangements sustaining norms are never fully stabilized and are at best relatively stable. Rhetorical contestation is thus always possible in theory, although it may not always be manifest in practice. Consequently, we focus on specific bounded episodes of contestation (McAdam et al., 2001: 29-30). Finally, existing accounts focusing on the strategic uses of public language -both constructivist (e.g. Risse, 2000) and rationalist (e.g. Riker, 1996)continue to be crafted around assertions about the 'interests' served by various rhetorical deployments and the 'motives' driving both speakers and targets. We seek to place the mechanism of rhetorical coercion on firmer methodological footing and, more broadly, to demonstrate the viability of a non-purposive social science. 8 Our skepticism regarding explanations rooted in the identification of motives is not novel. Hans Morgenthau, for one, declared the search for statesmen's motives 'futile' because 'motives are the most illusive of psychological data' (Morgenthau, 1993(Morgenthau, [1948]]: 5). Scholars in the rationalchoice tradition have offered similar observations (Frieden, 1999). Our 'solution', however, is more controversial. We are not prepared to follow our rational-choice colleagues down the path of assuming and deducing preferences. Rather, we take a less-traveled road and argue that social scientists should not begin by specifying the intentions of actors. Let us be clear: we are not arguing that actors do not possess motives, that those motives do not shape actors' behavior, or that such behavior is irrelevant to political outcomes. But we do aver that purposive accounts are analytically less useful than models in which preferences need not be specified or ranked. We therefore seek to minimize the place of motives as driving forces in our accounts of political processes and outcomes. We do not recommend this course lightly, for it flies in the face of deeply held epistemological commitments among social scientists in general and political scientists in particular. Purging empirical narratives of the language of subjective motivation is consequently difficult indeed. 9 Moreover, we recognize that all methodological choices are problematic, since the modeling of complex social processes requires abstracting from reality. Yet while this path is less traveled, it is by no means virgin ground. Many social scientists have distanced themselves from subjectivist understandings of culture as a coherent system of beliefs that might be ascertained through sophisticated survey techniques. We, like they, conceptualize culture as the always contested and often contradictory intersubjective semiotic practices through which social actors seek to generate meaning (Ross, 1997;Wedeen, 2002). Public semiotic codes constrain social actors regardless of whether they truly 'believe' in these codes' content, and thus the question of 'actual' belief is of little relevance (Weber, 1968;Jackson, 2002). Relational sociologists, most notably Charles Tilly, have maintained that individualist approaches commit the sin of reductionism: even if we did know people's motives, that would not help us explain social processes and outcomes. We follow these scholars in avoiding individual consciousness as a causal factor and in shifting 'the emphasis from consciousness to conversation, from action to interaction, from selves to sociabilities' (Tilly, 1998: 400; see also Emirbayer, 1997;and Shotter, 1993). These foundational theoretical moves serve as the point of departure for our model of rhetorical coercion. 10 We cannot observe directly what people think, but we can observe what they say and how they respond to claims and counter-claims. In our view, it does not matter whether actors believe what they say, whether they are motivated by crass material interests or sincere commitment. What is important is that they can be rhetorically maneuvered into a corner, trapped into publicly endorsing positions they may, or may not, find anathema. Rhetoric affects political outcomes even when all actors are cynical operators with little interest in genuine deliberation. The resolution of political issues through public debate need not imply any significant level of intersubjective consensus. Thinking about public rhetoric in this fashion avoids the crudeness of vulgar materialism, the reductionism of ideational approaches, and the heroic optimism of persuasion. Our perspective, which one might term 'coercive constructivism', both relates to and is different from existing approaches. Unlike both materialist and ideational accounts, we argue that language has a real causal impact on political outcomes. Unlike ideational approaches and liberal constructivism, we are skeptical that politics is more often characterized by puzzling than powering; we are equally skeptical that actors can transcend coercion and participate in fully rational deliberation. 11",
          "Rhetoric lies at the heart of politics. But many accounts of politics fail to accord it much weight, and many models fail to appreciate its explanatory leverage. This section seeks to explain how and why skillful rhetorical maneuvering can underpin a successful political campaign -not by persuading one's opponents of the rectitude of one's stance, but by denying them the rhetorical materials out of which to craft a socially sustainable rebuttal. Rhetorical coercion is a political strategy that seeks to twist arms by twisting tongues. This section proceeds by clarifying what rhetorical coercion is, how it operates, and the conditions under which it can be effective.",
          "We begin with a stylized account of an episode of rhetorical contestation. Seeking to effect change in some policy or ongoing course of action, a claimant (C) directs an argument toward the opposition (O) in view of a public (P). For the purposes of the model, it does not matter whether O has exclusive control over the actions at issue (if O is, for example, the government) or whether C and O share responsibility (if they are, for example, political parties in a legislative assembly). All that matters is that O's accession or resistance is critical to the outcome. Any argument that C puts forward contains two analytically separable parts: a frame (or set of terms) that characterizes the issue at hand and a set of implications that C suggests follows from that frame. For example, C might be a group of students protesting a war; their argument, advanced against the national government O through speeches and signs at a rally, portrays the war both to O and to P as unjust and unnecessary (frame) and calls for the end of hostilities and the withdrawal of troops (implications). In responding to C, O may accept or reject either or both the frame and the implications of C's argument. These alternatives yield four different potential outcomes of this episode of political contestation, reflected in Table 1. In case 1, O accepts both the frame and the implications of C's argument, and policy changes accordingly. 12 For C, this outcome represents an unmitigated triumph. Case 2 is more mixed. In case 2, O accepts the proposed implications and changes the policy, but it rejects C's reasoning. An example would be if an environmental movement (C) urged the government (O) to restrict logging for ecological reasons, and the government agreed to restrict logging but justified the policy shift in economic terms. Though the movement would have won the substantive battle, it might reasonably perceive its victory as less than complete; the government might in the future expand logging rights on economic grounds as easily as it had earlier restricted them on that very basis. It is possible that the environmentalists' rhetorical tactics drove the government's concessions, but determining that would require Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and  access to the authorities' true motives -something we earlier argued one can never ascertain. Both case 1 and case 2 mark (at least temporary) terminuses; contestation might resume at a later stage, but these cells represent relatively stable outcomes in the short to medium run. In contrast, cases 3 and 4 are cases of continued contestation. In case 3, O accepts the terms of C's arguments, but rejects the implications that C draws. For example, a lobbying group (C) may argue that high taxes are an unfair burden on the citizenry and should be reduced through an across-the-board reduction in tax rates; a political party (O) may agree that high taxes are problematic but suggest instead targeted tax cuts. As this relatively narrow policy debate occurs within a common issue frame, it might be termed an implication contest. In case 4, the two parties disagree about the very terms of debate as well as the policies that follow, and their rhetorical efforts consequently focus on advancing their preferred issue frame in the hope that their political opponents will accept it (along with the concomitant implications). Without a common frame bounding the debate, such rhetorical interchange -a framing contestis far more fluid, wide-ranging, and fundamental than in an implication contest. Politics is replete with such framing contests. Advocates of bilingual instruction invoke diversity and inter-cultural respect, while critics charge that instruction in anything other than the dominant language would threaten national ideals and students' eventual success in the marketplace. Opponents of abortion call the fetus an unborn child, portray the act as murder, and label themselves defenders of the right to life; supporters of abortion rights depict the fetus as an insentient being, portray the act as a medical procedure, and dub themselves the defenders of a woman's right to choose. Engaged in either an implication contest or a framing contest, C seeks through its claims and counter-claims to alter the rhetorical environment within which political battle is waged. While C might ideally prefer to persuade O, it must design a political strategy that can attain its desired ends even if persuasion proves impossible. The public plays a crucial role: both C and O must craft their appeals with an eye to some audience which sits in judgment of their rhetorical moves. If C can shift the rhetorical basis on which O justifies its stance to P, C can limit the range of O's possible responses and policy options, transcending the erstwhile implication or framing contest. Put simply, rhetorical coercion has taken place when this strategy proves successful -when O, regardless of its private beliefs, can no longer sustain its public opposition.",
          "Rhetorical contestation consists of parties attempting to maneuver each other onto more favorable rhetorical terrain and thereby to close off routes of European Journal of International Relations 13(1) acceptable rebuttal. Rhetorical coercion is successful when C's rhetorical moves deprive O of materials out of which to craft a reply that falls within the bounds of what P would accept. In the end, O finds itself, against its better judgment, endorsing (or at least acquiescing in) C's stance regardless of whether O has been persuaded or believes the words it utters. The alternatives -enduring punishment at the hands of P or investing significant resources in creating new terms of debate -would be prohibitively costly and time-consuming. In our model of rhetorical coercion, neither the motives nor the sincerity of the parties is particularly relevant. 13  C can succeed in rhetorically coercing O because of two key facts of social life. First, political actors can rarely take tangible steps or advance policy positions without justifying those stances and behaviors -in short, without framing. Politics may entail coercion or distribution, but at the same time it involves the struggle over meanings. Meanings, however, cannot be imposed unilaterally or through the exercise of material power alone. They are, by their very nature, intersubjective (Laffey and Weldes, 1997), and the effort to forge shared meaning implicates some audience in the process. The debate between C and O does not transpire in a vacuum: both are continually striving to legitimate their positions in P's eyes (Perelman, 1982). Second, speakers may not say just anything they would like in the public arena: rhetoric is not infinitely elastic but is structured. 14 Every community of discourse shares a number of topoi, or rhetorical commonplaces, that both enable and constrain speakers' rhetorical possibilities. These commonplaces are not 'fully predetermined, already decided distinctions', but weakly shared notions that can be 'expressed or formulated in different ways in different, concrete circumstances' (Shotter, 1993: 170-1). While C and O are free to weave together these commonplaces in creative ways, they are not free to deploy utterly alien formulations in the course of contestation: such arguments would fall, almost literally, on deaf ears. The available space for rhetorical contestation is, therefore, locally bounded, and the parties to a contentious episode cannot introduce entirely novel arguments. They must configure their appeals utilizing rhetorical tools drawn from a chest that is, in the short term, effectively fixed (Swidler, 1986). Rhetorical innovation, while possible and even inevitable in the long run, is far less likely in the short run for three reasons. First, while structures of discourse are never fully hegemonic and are continually being reworked, coherent political action would be impossible if rhetorical universes were in a state of continuous deep flux. Relative rhetorical stabilities must emerge to permit the construction of political strategies, and thus, at any given time, 'the terrain of dominant discourse is the only plausible arena of struggle' (Scott, 1990: 102). Second, imagining, formulating, and disseminating a brand-new commonplace requires an unusual level of commitment on the part of a claimant in terms of material resources, time, and effort. Deploying existing commonplaces -which have already been imagined, formulated, and disseminated -is far less costly (McAdam et al., 2001: 47-50). The process of transforming an unusual rhetorical form into a commonplace is necessarily lengthy and uncertain, but political actors normally possess far shorter time horizons. Arguments can prove powerful only when the commonplaces on which they draw are already present in the rhetorical field, which is shaped both by the unintended consequences of prior episodes of contestation and/or by campaigns undertaken in advance with the express purpose of reconfiguring the rhetorical terrain. Third, and related, novel rhetorical resources are likely to be drowned out by existing arguments and frames. Dense networks of communication carry and regularly reinforce established commonplaces, overwhelming proffered alternatives. Rhetorical innovations consequently tend to arise at the margins, where communication networks are less dense. Overcoming such barriers is possible in principle, but it is in reality so improbable that C and O must, in a given contentious episode, play within the rhetorical arena that presents itself to them. And that arena privileges particular frames and places others beyond the pale, regardless of the material resources at the speaker's disposal. If C and O were the only two actors in our stylized story, they might introduce novel arguments costlessly and endlessly, and rhetorical coercion would then be impossible. Their rhetorical maneuvers are constrained, however, because rhetorical contestation is public in nature (Bennett, 1980: 805-6). The continual competition for public legitimation ensures that P occupies a critical position, setting limits to the policy stances that the contestants can in practice advance. The relevant audience sets the contours of rhetorical contestation, and stepping beyond or reshaping them requires an investment not attractive or even feasible in the short run. This focus on the public's role constitutes a point of intersection with scholars in the rational-choice tradition who have ascribed great importance to 'audience costs' (Fearon, 1994). In such models, the actors and the audience have clear and consistent preferences that precede the contentious episode; public pronouncements serve to signal the content and/or intensity of those preferences. By contrast, our model does not begin by identifying and ordering the parties' desires, and the outcome of a particular episode does not depend on these preferences' content or ranking. Instead, the importance of the public P lies in the imperative for appeal frames to draw on rhetorical commonplaces present in the public's everyday deliberations (Shotter, 1993: 65-9; see also Bennett, 1980). Our model presumes not that European Journal of International Relations 13(1) P has a well-thought-out position in advance on the issue being contested, but rather that there is only a limited set of arguments that P would, in principle, find minimally acceptable. 15  In sum, one argument 'wins' not because its grounds are 'valid' in the sense of satisfying the demands of universal reason or because it accords with the audience's prior normative commitments or material interests, but because its grounds are socially sustainable -because the audience deems certain rhetorical deployments acceptable and others impermissible. One cannot, however, fashion strict covering laws regarding the audience's response. Students of conversation and argumentation from across several disciplines (anthropology, communication, sociology, philosophy, psychology) have argued that context is unusually crucial to their field of study (Billig, 1996;Gumperz, 1982;Perelman, 1982;Sawyer, 2001;Shotter, 1993;Toulmin, 1958). Classifying structures of discourse, reconstructing the rhetorical possibilities, exploring the rhetorical interplay: these critical challenges require one to formulate arguments limited in time and space and limited by the arena of rhetorical competition. Thus, for example, we do not ask below what sorts of appeals are most effective in general at compelling authorities to grant oppressed minorities first-class citizenship. Rather, through an interrogation of the Israeli case, we suggest that a specific claim (framed around military sacrifice and the equation of rights and obligations) is more likely to be successful in a particular discursive context (when talk about citizenship is narrowly republican). Such an explanation is modest, yet powerful, and potentially generalizable.",
          "The logic of rhetorical coercion suggests that two factors are most important in explaining when the model will have explanatory value. First, is P a relevant party to C's claims-making? Recall that C's power is rooted in its credible threat, implicit or explicit, to bring P in on its side; C's ability to do so deprives O of the option of refusing to respond to or even acknowledge C's claims. If C cannot issue its threat credibly, then O can safely ignore C's claims, no matter how they are framed. We can readily imagine conditions under which P would not be relevant to the interaction between the protagonists in our stylized story. It may be that P simply cannot hear C -perhaps because C is being actively repressed; perhaps because C lacks sufficient resources to publicize its message; or perhaps because C's claims regard alleged misdeeds that transpire far from the public eye. 16 Moreover, in some social contexts, decisions need not be justified. 17 The prevalence of justificatory behavior in the political arena suggests, however, that we are correct to maintain that the scope of the model's application is quite large.",
          "Second, how limited is the universe of rhetorical commonplaces? We have argued that actors must, in any particular claims-making episode, forge their appeals by drawing upon existing commonplaces that represent the boundaries of legitimate framing. When these boundaries are loose, numerous rhetorical strands are available, ensuring that O can almost always put forward a meaningful rebuttal to C. In such circumstances, the terms of debate are hardly constraining. When these boundaries are relatively restricted, rhetorical coercion is more easily achieved, as O has less rhetorical 'wiggle room' -that is, fewer socially plausible ways of rebutting C's claim. We recognize that verbal appeals are multivocal, that advocates and opponents of particular policies may advance their arguments employing similar terms. But public language, in our view, is never infinitely flexible, and even so capacious a rhetorical formulation as that of 'rights' in the American context disciplines the speaker. Such disciplining is more common and thus rhetorical coercion is more likely when speakers have fewer commonplaces on which to draw. 18",
          "One of the most venerable norms in the West is that linking military service and citizenship. 'Whoever puts himself in the service of the state', observed Otto Hintze, 'must logically and fairly be granted the regular rights of citizenship' (Hintze, 1975: 211), and the call to the colors is widely considered the supreme example of state service (Janowitz, 1976). Thus the leaders of those relegated to second-class citizenship have often counseled in wartime against draft evasion and have even urged voluntary enlistment. Afterwards they have shrewdly contrasted their people's record of loyalty and sacrifice to the reality of entrenched political and social inequity. For instance, African-Americans volunteered in droves for the Union Army in the US Civil War and for the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, wrapping their postwar demands in the bloody flag. The rhetoric of military sacrifice has at times proven effective. Mobilized veterans have most obviously exploited their status to gain both political rights and distributional benefits. Oppressed and marginalized ethnic, racial, and religious groups have, based upon their collective sacrifice, also advanced claims for citizenship rights, albeit with varying degrees of success. African-Americans, for example, have repeatedly found this path to citizenship blocked. But their lack of postwar progress is hardly surprising given the high stakes of citizenship battles. The demands of subordinate groups for first-class citizenship challenge the core of the existing social order, and the opposition to meaningful change is consequently often fierce. It is not African-Americans' repeated failures that require explanation as much as the successes of others -such as American women after World War I, Japanese-Americans European Journal of International Relations 13(1) after World War II, and Sikhs in post-independence India -in deploying the rhetoric of sacrifice to win improvements in their status. The opponents of reform typically occupy powerful positions in political, social, and economic structures, and few would expect them to give way before words alone. The politics of citizenship is thus a 'hard case' for the power of rhetoric, for material interests and resources would appear to provide a ready explanation for which groups' citizenship claims are granted and which are denied. We will argue, however, that the particular rhetorical configurations advanced by Israel's various Arab minorities help explain these groups' differential rates of success in overcoming the barriers to first-class citizenship in this 'ethnic democracy' (Smooha, 1997). Drawing on their record of military service, Druze Arabs argued that equal obligations demand equal rights. Jewish politicians found themselves unable to craft a culturally meaningful rebuttal to Druze demands, and they were compelled to concede Druze claims. In contrast, Christian and Muslim Arabs, who have never been drafted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), insisted that Israel abide by its public commitment to liberal democracy. While this frame also drew on Israeli commonplaces, it permitted Jewish politicians to justify discrimination against Christians and Muslims by arguing that those who do not perform civic duties cannot lay claim to equivalent public rights and benefits. Although the Druze were poorer than their fellow Arabs and smaller in number, for many years they were more effective in placing their concerns on the national agenda and in garnering a favorable response from the authorities. Consequently, material factors cannot account for the success of the Druze relative to other Arabs, and Jewish politicians' continual resistance to Druze demands suggests that persuasion was not at work. Israel's relationship with its Arab minorities nicely illustrates the power and limits of rhetorical coercion. 19   Background Israel's Arab population -today well over a million strongis divided by religion, with the Muslims, the Christians, and the Druze constituting the three largest groups. Possessing basic political rights, the entire Arab community has enjoyed great socioeconomic progress since Israel's founding in 1948, particularly relative to Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and to Arabs throughout the Middle East. Yet they have also been openly labeled a fifth column, and they have, often without regard to religious affiliation, been the victims of variegated forms of discrimination on the part of the state and the majority Jewish population. The new Israeli government subjected Arabs to military rule, conducted pervasive surveillance within the Arab communities, limited Arabs' capacity for travel and an independent economy, expropriated the bulk of Arab-controlled land, excluded Arabs from the giant labor Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms federation known as the Histadrut, and so on. Jewish leaders typically invoked the language of security to justify these policies, but its broad definition encompassed ideological, economic, and even partisan interests as well as security more narrowly conceived. Much overt discrimination came to an end by the late 1960s, but substantial discrimination persisted in more subtle forms (Kretzmer, 1988;Lustick, 1980;Shafir and Peled, 2002). Starting from this common baseline, however, the paths of Israel's Arab minorities have diverged. While all continue today to endure second-class status relative to Jewish Israelis, the Druze have made greater headway than the larger and wealthier Christian and Muslim communities. Since 1956 the Druze have been able to deploy a set of rhetorical commonplaces unavailable to their Christian and Muslim neighbors. That year, male Druze became subject to the military draft, reversing a policy of exemption that had been applied to all Arabs since the passage of Israel's universal conscription law in 1950 (Peled, 1998). Some have speculated plausibly that the Israeli authorities hoped that Druze service in the IDF would provide proof of Israeli liberalism and thereby neutralize Arab nationalists and satisfy Western critics (Firro, 1999;Lustick, 1980), but even full declassification of the relevant documents would not definitively establish the government's motives. We argue that, regardless of who wanted to draft the Druze and why, conscription helped the Druze prosper in Israeli politics.",
          "In the mid-1960s, the Druze began to mobilize, and they regularly sought a public forum in which to air their grievances, which they consistently framed around their people's military service and the equation of rights and obligations. In 1967 Druze activists circulated widely an appeal insisting that 'since we have done our duties … and see in the lack of equality … an infringement and denial of our rights, we urgently demand correction of this wrong' (Firro, 1999: 187). Surveying the history of Druze claims-making, one scholar noted that, among both Jews and the Druze, 'injustices to individual Druzes are usually attacked as ingratitude toward a man who was willing to shed his blood for his country, but now his country turns against him' (Ben Dor, 1979: 134-5). Even in recent years, the Druze have continued to gravitate to this rhetorical mode. During a series of public protests in the 1990s, mayors of Druze villages and towns 'usually denounce [ed] the Israeli government for its broken promises, and stress[ed] the price paid by the community in the form of hundreds of Druze soldiers killed during their service in the Israeli army' (Yiftachel and Segal, 1998: 487). Even the minority of Druze who have objected to the draft have accepted these basic terms. As a Communist Druze Knesset representative argued in the early 1990s, 'If this is a blood covenant, then give us the feeling that we are living in our state, in our homeland, with full rights like all citizens . . . And if there is to be no equality European Journal of International Relations 13(1) of rights, then do not demand equality of obligations, and allow Druze to choose -to serve or not to serve in the IDF' (Zohar, 1991). In constructing their claims frame, the Druze have drawn on rhetorical commonplaces deeply rooted in Israel's rhetorical traditions. Although participation in the pre-state Jewish community, the yishuv, was necessarily voluntary, it prized individual and group commitment to the public good, defined as the historical mission of the Jewish people to rebuild the land of Israel and epitomized by the kibbutz movement. The new state preserved this emphasis on civic commitment as the basis for membership, grafting a powerful statist ideology onto the earlier discourse (Liebman and Don Yihya, 1983). In an early Knesset debate, Prime Minister David Ben Gurion insisted that women too be subject to the draft, bluntly declaring, 'There are no rights without obligations. And above all is the obligation of security, the obligation of defending our existence, our freedom, our independence, and our growth' (Divre Ha-Knesset, 1950: 3:537). Even dissidents have protested within the terms of this dominant definition of citizenship: as one conscientious objector from the Lebanon War put it, 'military service, paying taxes, and obeying the law . . . That is what makes you a citizen and makes you eligible to enjoy the defense and the fruits that [the state] equally distributes' (Helman, 2000: 324). 20  This civic republican tradition has long sat uncomfortably alongside an ascriptive component in the definition of the Israeli polity. The 1948 Declaration of Independence proclaimed the new country 'the Jewish state' even as it promised that Israel would promote the welfare and protect the basic freedoms of all its inhabitants. The country's formal name, the State of Israel, suggests an abiding commitment to pluralistic secularism, but its historical-religious title, the Land of Israel, remains in popular use (Kimmerling, 1985). Some have concluded that 'Jewish ethnicity is a necessary condition for membership in the political community, while the contribution to the process of Jewish national redemption is a measure of one's civic virtue' (Peled, 1992: 435). Yet this ignores the potential contradictions between these discourses. Such tensions are muted when only Jewish citizens are drafted, for then Israeli leaders can publicly embrace civic republicanism while preserving ethnoreligious priorities. But Druze claims-making framed around collective military sacrifice challenged the coherence of Israel's 'ethnorepublican' citizenship. Confronted with such a challenge, Jewish Israeli leaders had two alternatives: either they could acknowledge their exclusive definition of the political community, or they could open its doors. While the Druze squeezed concessions out of Jewish politicians beginning in the late 1960s, there is no evidence that their appeals were persuasive: both the limited and incremental nature of Israeli concessions as well as the grudging fashion in which they were offered are not consistent with a narrative centered Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms around persuasion. Rather, our model of rhetorical coercion can help explain why the Druze made headway in this ethnic democracy. Faced with Druze claims, Jewish leaders could have launched a framing contest by (a) admitting openly the discriminatory nature of the state. Alternatively, they could have conceded the Druze frame but challenged its implications by (b) claiming that the Druze were not relatively disadvantaged or (c) arguing that the Druze community's problems were of its own making. The first alternative frame was unappealing -not just because of the likely international repercussions, but also because it would have contradicted both Israel's self-proclaimed status as the sole democracy in the Middle East and its dominant way of speaking about citizenship. The second put forward a claim widely known to be false, and the third possible response, while perhaps plausible with regard to questions of economic development, could not justify administrative segregation, which was, whether cleverly or fortunately, among Druze activists' first targets. There was, however, a fourth option: Jewish politicians could have refused to reply -as long as relevant audiences were unaware of the Druze's plight. The Druze's capacity to engage in rhetorical coercion was consequently dependent on garnering attention from the Hebrew-language media. As a general rule, the Hebrew press rarely covered the Arab communities, for its readership was almost entirely Jewish. But the Druze arguments were resonant with republican rhetorical practice, producing a narrative that Jewish publics comprehended and embraced. As a result, when the Druze made noise, the press amplified it, compensating for the Druze's lack of political clout and ensuring a hearing in the halls of power (Asa'ad, 2000;Toledano, 2000). In short, the Druze trapped Jewish leaders in a rhetorical cul-de-sac in which an implication or framing contest was unsustainable. They maneuvered their Jewish opponents onto a rhetorical playing field on which the Druze could not lose, for no rebuttal would have been acceptable to key audiences, both domestic and international. Wary of calling punishment upon themselves, Jewish leaders had little choice but to concede. Consequently, 'when the Druze demanded something, the ears were much more open' (Toledano, 2000). Despite the Druze community's electoral insignificance, cases of alleged discrimination against individual Druze received attention even in the Knesset (Ben Dor, 1979: 134-6). The Druze demand in the late 1960s for full membership in the Labor Party was irrefutable: as a prominent Labor functionary wrote in a major newspaper, 'How can we explain to that Druze … that he is good enough to endanger his life for the state but that he is not good enough to be a member of the Labor Party?' (Lin, 1970). Confident that their rhetorical resources have bequeathed disproportionate influence, the Druze have resisted an alliance with their numerous fellow Arabs, with whom they share many grievances. Even those Druze otherwise critical of Israel's policies have often supported continued conscription so that European Journal of International Relations 13(1) the military sacrifice frame would remain available. Lacking abundant political resources, the Druze adopted a strategy aimed at rhetorical coercion, and they demonstrated that it could work. Jewish politicians were compelled to say things they (likely) did not believe and ultimately even to follow through on those promises. Like their Druze counterparts, Christian and Muslim Arabs drew on Israeli commonplaces, arguing that Israel needed to eliminate discriminatory measures to live up to its democratic promise. Yet, in comparison to the Druze, they have encountered far greater public resistance, for Jewish politicians had a rhetorical escape hatch. Arab rights, they often argued, were not sacrosanct, for those who did not fulfill their civic obligations (that is, military service) deserved less protection than those who had made the supreme sacrifice. In seeking to convince a wavering Knesset member to support the military administration in 1962, Ben Gurion protested, 'I have recognized all these years that rights are dependent on obligations . . . I do not understand why I may limit the freedom and steal the time of young Jewish men and women when they are in the army, but why it is forbidden to limit much less the freedom of those who do not serve in the army.' 21 That same Labor functionary who advocated offering the Druze membership in the party justified the exclusion of other Arabs on similar grounds: 'I asked them [close Arab friends] how they could sit in the party central committee … next to a bereaved father or mother, next to a party member who had just returned from the front, next to a member who stands ready to leave the next day for reserve service, while they still do not fulfill this obligation' (Lin, 1970). Faced with claims framed in liberal terms, Jewish leaders had a response at the ready, evading the rhetorical dead-end into which Christians and Muslims might have hoped to maneuver them. For decades, this rhetorical move has frustrated Arab efforts to attain first-class citizenship. As one Arab activist recently complained, 'They are trying to link our rights as citizens to performing military service. That's not how a real democracy works' (quoted in Schechter, 2003). Christian and Muslim claimants have long remained mired in a framing contest, unable to persuade or rhetorically coerce Jewish politicians. 22   Alternative Explanations How else might one explain the relative success of the Druze in attaining increments of Israeli effective citizenship? The most intuitive answer would attribute this outcome to the distribution of material resources. But the Druze's potential voter base has been tiny, their per capita income has remained relatively low, they have historically eschewed violent confrontation with the authorities, and they have often had difficulty creating and sustaining effective lobbying organizations (Firro, 1999). By all standard measures of political power, the Druze should have been less successful than other Arabs, not more so.",
          "A second alternative would invert the first. Precisely because the Druze were so small, so weak, and so moderate, Israel could countenance their inclusion in the IDF and grant them some modicum of effective citizenship without threatening the state's Jewish identity. Had the Druze's population been as large as Israel's Christian or Muslim communities, concessions would have been unthinkable. The Druze's small size made them an attractive target for cooptation (Lustick, 1980). But if this argument were correct, presumably the state should have flung its doors wide open, for the costs would have been negligible and the propaganda advantages substantial. In fact, however, while Jewish decision-makers readily offered rhetorical concessions to the Druze, they resisted implementation: 'To say that if the ears were open, things were done -there is a difference' (Toledano, 2000). The Druze made tangible progress, but they fought hard for those increments of meaningful citizenship. Nor did the Druze act like a model coopted minority. They were not content with petty favors, but rather became deeply dissatisfied with their status and continually presented Jewish leaders with difficult and uncomfortable choices. A third alternative would posit that Israel's conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 and the addition of a large, politicized Palestinian population gave Jewish politicians incentives to grant Druze citizens' demands so as to prevent the Palestinization of the Druze community. Presumably, however, they faced far greater incentives to accommodate the much larger Christian and Muslim citizen populations, whose members had not yet openly allied with the Palestinian national cause. Nevertheless, the Israeli establishment remained highly resistant to Christian and Muslim claims-making. This argument thus has difficulty accounting for the divergent patterns in Israel's relations with its various Arab communities after 1967 -a difficulty not faced by the mechanism of rhetorical coercion. A fourth alternative account would attribute the Druze anomaly to their predilection for taqiyya, or the art of concealment. 23 Long viewed as heretics by their Muslim neighbors, the Druze have historically sought to shield themselves from persecution by hiding their religious observances. With regard to politics, this ultra-pragmatic doctrine prescribes neutrality when possible and 'bandwagoning' -allying with the likely victor -when necessary (Layish, 1985). One would thus have expected the Druze to avoid challenging stronger parties, but in fact the Druze displayed a rebellious streak during Ottoman and European colonial domination of the region. Despite a long history of communal tension, they made common cause with their fellow Arabs in the struggle for Lebanese autonomy early in the 20th century. And, frustrated that one foreign ruler had simply replaced another, their leadership initiated a nationalist revolt against the French in the mid-1920s -with disastrous consequences (Tauber, 1993a(Tauber, , 1993b;;Firro, 1999). The Druze were not proto-nationalists, but they were at times willing to set aside intra-Arab differences, compelling one to ask why they European Journal of International Relations 13(1) did not cast their lot with other Arabs in Israel in the decades after 1948. Taqiyya is obviously of little help in answering this question. Equally important, it lacks analytical bite. The doctrine is so flexible that it is less an explanation for Druze behavior than a tidy description of it.",
          "The Druze's success in compelling Jewish Israeli politicians to grant them a modicum of first-class citizenship illustrates nicely the operation of rhetorical coercion. Although this single case study cannot of course prove that the mechanism is generalizable, we view rhetorical coercion as among the set of 'widely operating explanatory mechanisms that combine differently and therefore produce different outcomes in one setting or another ' (McAdam et al., 2001: 13-14). The Druze case suggests the applicability of rhetorical coercion to domestic politics, but is the mechanism operative in the international arena? Extending the earlier theoretical discussion leads to the conclusion that rhetorical coercion is more likely as social ties in political communities, domestic and even international, grow increasingly extensive and dense. On the whole, however, rhetorical coercion will operate less effectively and less frequently in international settings. Key factors highlighted by the model are often present in international relations: state leaders speak to international audiences, they are sensitive to those audiences' reactions, and justificatory speech acts are prevalent. Indeed, while not systematically elaborating the mechanism's dynamics, others have shown rhetorical coercion to be of critical explanatory importance in such divergent contexts as Cold War crisis bargaining (Bially Mattern, 2004), intra-Arab alliance dynamics (Barnett, 1998), eastward enlargement of the European Union and NATO (Fierke and Wiener, 1999;Schimmelfenig, 2004), and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev's proposals for nuclear disarmament (Evangelista, 2001). Yet even these examples suggest the limits of rhetorical coercion in international politics. Rhetorical coercion, like other forms of political communication, is premised on a political community that shares at least some understandings of the boundaries of acceptable discourse. The more tightly linked the community, the greater the possibilities for rhetorical coercion. Thus it is not surprising to find this mechanism primarily operative among regional groupings with relatively strong requirements for legitimation. The Soviet Union had long legitimated its leadership of the communist bloc by casting itself as the true force for global peace, and its routine calls for nuclear disarmament sustained that claim; Soviet generals could not publicly dispute Gorbachev's proposal without simultaneously undercutting Soviet authority among communist regimes. Similarly, Egypt had, under Nasser, positioned itself as the leader of the Arab world Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms based on a pan-Arab discourse that represented Israel as its inherently opposed Other; Nasser reluctantly accepted the risk of war with Israel in 1967 because deviating from the norms of Arab nationalist discourse would have imperiled Egypt's status as the spokesman for Arab nationalism and might have jeopardized his regime's stability. Finally, the European Union, the most tightly bound regional arrangement on the globe today, could not have denied membership to consolidated democracies in Eastern Europe without contradicting the community's legitimating discourse which had intertwined the European concept with liberal democracy; to have vetoed or even vocally opposed eastward enlargement would have challenged the basis for community and threatened individual members' credibility. Such dynamics thus depend on the strength and density of the ties binding the community's members, and such ties vary substantially across the international system. 24 Where such ties are strong and dense -that is, within such regional groupings of states, where international anarchy (as even realists might concede) is most attenuated -rhetorical coercion remains distinctly possible. The cosmopolitan dream of a 'global public' remains today just that, although there are emerging global standards of legitimacy in several arenas and increasingly robust mechanisms through which norm violators might be held accountable (Grant and Keohane, 2005). Where such ties are weak and sparse -as in relations across such regional groupings and as in the many arenas lacking shared bases for legitimation -rhetorical coercion will be far more difficult. As the metaphor of the two-level game implies, political elites in such circumstances are likely to be engaged with and responsive to multiple and different audiences simultaneously, and these audiences are unlikely to share a single conception of what rhetorical moves are acceptable and appropriate. The more complex the social environment, the greater the opportunities for actors to evade the consequences of rhetorical interchange, and thus the more imposing the obstacles to rhetorical coercion. Where such ties have never existed or have been ruptured -perhaps as a consequence of the limits of communications technologies or perhaps as a result of enduring interstate rivalry -communication (including rhetorical coercion) is impossible, and diplomacy is a dialogue of the deaf. As a consequence, it is not the imposing capacity of foreign publics, let alone some elusive global public, to sanction state action that makes rhetorical coercion potentially successful on the international scene. When rhetorical coercion is operative internationally, the critical punishing agent is more often a domestic audience prepared to exact costs for violations of standards of rhetorical appropriateness. While foreigners have disapproved of American unilateralism in recent years, it is not clear that this opposition has driven their governments' policies (Brooks and Wohlforth, 2005), and while anti-Americanism has unquestionably been prevalent, its political consequences European Journal of International Relations 13(1) appear to have often been exaggerated (Keohane and Katzenstein, 2006). The George W. Bush administration could dismiss foreign opposition to the Iraq War, particularly because cooperation on matters of joint concern such as trade and terrorism (narrowly construed) continued seemingly unabated. But the American public's increasing disenchantment with the war has been a far greater cause for concern for the administration, as it is this public that might be directly brought into a political contest over the war -a political contest within which rhetorical coercion is far more likely to operate. 25",
          "Machiavelli famously advised that 'a ruler need not have all the positive qualities …but he must seem to have them… He must seem, to those who listen to him and watch him, entirely pious, truthful, reliable, sympathetic, and religious' (Machiavelli, 1994: 55). Realists, not inaccurately, read Machiavelli as warning against allowing moral considerations to impede actions necessary for the pursuit of political power. But, as coercive constructivists, we would add that these lines imply that social identity has an effect on social and political outcomes, regardless of whether or not the actor internalizes the components constituting this identity. A ruler pursuing policies incapable of public justification would find her path strewn with numerous practical obstacles. This lack of rhetorical resources might even compel her to alter her course of action. In accord with other constructivists, we aver that social norms and social identities matter. 26 In accord with political realists, we argue that whether or not a social actor has internalized a particular set of normative principles is not causally relevant. In accord with the broader cultural turn in the social sciences, we combine these positions by focusing on public language, on how normative principles are deployed in public debate, and by exploring the causal impact this deployment can have on what people say and consequently on what they do -not on the impossibly elusive question of what they believe. Our model of rhetorical coercion can helpfully capture the dynamics of framing contests, when there is controversy about how an issue should be characterized, and of implication contests, when narrower (yet no less important) battles are waged over the consequences of some accepted framing. Our analysis draws attention to two key conditions affecting the applicability of the model. First, rhetorical coercion can occur only when the public is a party to the debate or when the claimant can credibly threaten to involve the audience. Second, not all structures of discourse are equally conducive to rhetorical coercion. This mechanism is more likely to operate when these structures are relatively restricted (and constraining) than when they are relatively loose (and permissive). Furthermore, our model cannot illuminate the process of rhetorical contest in two circumstances: first, when an opponent accepts a claim without argument, and, second, when an opponent accepts the implications of an argument but not its terms. We contend, however, that much social and political life lies within our model's scope. 27  In short, this article seeks to invigorate the study of political rhetoricbut in a fashion relatively unfamiliar to recent debates in international and comparative politics. We argue that rhetorical contestation shapes policy outcomes and that the approaches most common in these subfields miss a significant portion of political and social reality. We further suggest that it is possible to make causal claims without trespassing into the murky waters of subjective motivation and without relying on problematic mechanisms like persuasion. Many IR constructivists would be comfortable with the first of these claims, many realists and students of political culture with the second, few from either camp with their combination. This article has sought to demonstrate that their conjunction is both logically sustainable and potentially productive.",
          "material interests' problematic and have instead embraced a linguistic focus that is not dissimilar to our own. 5. Among those drawing on social psychology are Checkel (2001); Crawford (2002: 26-7);and Johnston (2001). Others have remained agnostic as to how persuasion operates (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998). We limit ourselves here to discussion of the Habermasian version of the persuasion argument, since in our judgment it is the most clearly articulated mechanism. For an alternative treatment of Habermas in international relations, see Mitzen (2005). 6. On the lack of evidence of changed minds in Crawford (2002), see Dessler and Owen (2005: 602). 7. We are grateful to Kathryn Sikkink for helpful discussion on this point. 8. For treatments closer to our own, see, among others, Barnett (1998); Bially Mattern (2004); Fierke (1998); Goddard (2006). 9. Such language even slips on occasion into our own case study, for the conventions of historical writing insist on subjects who possess agency, articulate goals, and pursue motives. The Foucauldian alternative -interrogating the central discursive formations -might help us escape this trap, but it would come at the cost of the narrative form, which better captures the tensions and surprising reversals of actual political contest. Such traces of motivational language are consequently inevitable, but they should not cloud or draw attention from the rhetorical dynamics themselves. We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pressing us on this point. 10. The distinction between persuasion and coercion as modes of political influence is by no means original, but our conceptualization of rhetorical contestation as potentially coercive is more unusual. Scholars, especially those working within a psychological framework, sometimes treat persuasion as synonymous with all attitude change, citing even nuclear deterrence as an example. In contrast, we define coercion as the imposition of constraint on choice, whereas normative persuasion seeks ideally to bypass choice. Both coercion and persuasion may lead the target to assent, but the coerced target merely complies, while the persuaded target consents. Put differently, persuasion speaks to change in preferences, while coercion seeks to alter the social environment confronting an actor while leaving preferences untouched. 11. For a related discussion of 'realist constructivism', see Jackson and Nexon (2004). 12. Note that 'acceptance' here does not imply agreement, but refers only to O's public reaction to C's argument. 13. While we make no strong assumptions regarding the content of the actors' motives, the model does rely on the thin, almost trivial, assumption that actors are fundamentally strategic -that they pursue policies that they believe will further their goals (McAdam et al., 2001). 14. For related arguments, see Cruz (2000); Spillman (1995); Steinberg (1999). 15. In this stylized model, we presume that both actors must legitimate their stance in the eyes of the same audience, but the reality of both international and domestic politics is often more complicated. Speakers in both arenas may be playing to entirely different audiences or may be competing to define which audience is in fact relevant. The dynamics of such contestation are not well addressed by this paper and will be taken up in future articles. We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for raising this question. 16. This is not infrequently the case when O is a government whose commands are implemented by a secretive bureaucracy. A potential weakness of rhetorical coercion is its implication that rhetorical concessions translate smoothly into policy change. O may renege on its commitments, particularly during implementation when there may be little need for public justification. While such breakdowns are likely, we maintain that violations will prove difficult to sustain should C hold O's feet to the public fire in a new episode of rhetorical contestation. 17. Superiors often do not explain their logic to subordinates, and exasperated parents often tell children, 'Just do as I say!' In such circumstances, rhetorical contestation is not likely to be effective. We are grateful to Robert Jervis for pointing this out. 18. For more on the logic of rhetorical coercion, see Jackson (2006); Krebs (2006). 19. For a more extensive treatment of these cases, see Krebs (2006: Chs 3-5). 20. Military service occupies so prominent a site in the Israeli cultural complex that 'civic virtue has been constructed in terms of and identified with military virtue' (Helman, 2000: 320). 21. Ben Gurion to M.K. Yizhar, 12 February 1962, State Archives (Jerusalem, Israel), Office of the Prime Minister Files, C 6304/1086. 22. Christians and Muslims could not control the rhetorical playing field, but they nevertheless made significant gains in the mid-1980s thanks to their raw political power. After the 1977 breakdown of Labor Zionism's stranglehold over the political system, the electoral competition tightened, and the Arab population was actively wooed. Candidates from across the political spectrum stumped for the first time in Arab villages, and the major parties committed themselves to improving the Arabs' lot. 23. A different version of the cultural argument, which Druze and Jews alike have relished, argues that the two peoples are natural allies as fellow minorities in the Muslim Middle East. But the assertion of a natural Jewish-Druze affinity is propagandistic rhetoric that has, since the founding of Israel, served the interests of both Israeli officials and Druze leaders. Druze religious texts are typically dismissive of other religions, and while particularly disparaging of Islam -the dominant regional religious tradition responsible for their oppression -they are hardly admiring of Jews. See Parsons (2001: 70-6); and Dana (2003: 43-51). 24. As this formulation suggests, we believe that network analysis provides a more useful set of tools for grasping such variation than do metaphors regarding, for example, the 'thickness' of the 'normative environment' (Barnett, 1998: 39). For an insightful application of network logic to imperial dynamics, see Nexon and Wright (forthcoming). 25. Consider also the examples discussed earlier. That audiences in the communist bloc outside the USSR might have questioned Soviet leadership or that Arab elites might have challenged Egypt's did matter, but primarily indirectly. Had the Soviet generals or Nasser anticipated that domestic audiences would respond to the prospective loss of regional or ideological authority with collective indifference, they would have perceived themselves to be operating with a far freer hand. That domestic audiences were sensitive to their country's standing in the relevant community of nations, and were believed to be prepared to act on that basis, was crucial in these cases. 26. The language of identity has not figured explicitly in this article, but it is our view that rhetoric and identity are inseparable. Identity is not the mental property of an individual, nor can collective identity be apprehended by aggregating the attitudes of the constituent individuals. Rather, identities are necessarily relational, and thus they are forged through the process of their articulation. Political communities are defined by a common rhetorical lexicon and coalesce around particular rhetorical configurations. 27. Our model cannot, however, capture the long-term processes through which new commonplaces enter the rhetorical space."

Over the past 15-20 years, however, a new discourse on social factors and health-with wider relevance to the general population-has emerged in the United States, building on earlier work in Europe and Canada. Figure 1 illustrates the rapidly growing literature on the social (including economic) determinants of health (SDOH) in the United States and elsewhere. The concept is becoming far less marginal in the U.S. public health realm in general, not only in academia; the SDOH have received increasing attention from public health and nonprofit agencies (21,29,88,90,113).

States and other countries (1, 10, 123) has led to increased understanding of how social factors influence health and has enhanced the scientific credibility of relevant efforts. Notable recent initiatives include the World Health Organization (WHO) Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (122), the MacArthur Foundation Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health (111), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission to Build a Healthier America (91). Incremental improvements in health with increasing social advantage have now been observed in the United States (14) as well as in Europe (69,92), indicating the relevance of SDOH for middle-class as well as the most disadvantaged Americans. Systematic efforts have disseminated this knowledge and made it compelling for broader U.S. audiences (17,91). An increasing focus among U.S. researchers, health agencies, and advocates on the concept of health equity has also contributed, encompassing the spectrum of causesincluding social determinants-of racial/ ethnic and other social disparities in health that raise concerns about justice (8, 15, 79,88,113).

          "The term social determinant of health is often used to refer broadly to any nonmedical factors influencing health, including health-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors (such as smoking). These factors, however, represent only the most downstream determinants in the causal pathways influencing health; they are shaped by more upstream determinants. To illustrate the upstream/downstream metaphor, consider people living near a river who become ill from drinking water contaminated by toxic chemicals originating from a factory located upstream. Although drinking the contaminated water is the most proximate or downstream cause of illness, the more fundamental (yet potentially less evident, given its temporal and physical distance from those affected) cause is the upstream dumping of chemicals. A downstream remedy might recommend that individuals buy filters to treat the contaminated water before drinking; because more affluent individuals could better afford the filters or bottled water, socioeconomic disparities in illness would be expected. The upstream solution, focused on the source of contamination, would end the factory's dumping. Although these concepts may make intuitive sense, the causal pathways linking upstream determinants with downstream determinants, and ultimately with health, are typically long and complex, often involving multiple intervening and potentially interacting factors along the way. This complexity generally makes it easier to studyand address-downstream determinants, at the risk of failing to address fundamental causes. This article focuses on the more upstream social determinants of health-the factors that play a more fundamental causal role and represent the most important opportunities for improving health and reducing health disparities. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual framework for the RWJF Commission's work. Although the relationships are more complex, this simplified schema highlights several important concepts. First, it shows that healthrelated behaviors and receipt of recommended medical care (key downstream determinants of an individual's health) do not occur in a vacuum. Rather, these factors are shaped by more upstream determinants related to the living and working conditions that can influence health both directly (e.g., through toxic exposures or stressful experiences) and indirectly (by shaping",

The diagram highlights how health is shaped not only by living and working conditions, but also by even more upstream determinants that reflect the economic and social resources and opportunities that influence an individual's access to health-promoting living and working conditions and to healthy choices.",
          "Evidence from decades of research examining associations between key social factorsprimarily educational attainment and income in the United States and occupational grade (ranking) in Europe-and health outcomes throughout the life course overwhelmingly links greater social disadvantage with poorer health (1, 10, 27,46,66,67). The striking and pervasive-albeit not universal-patterns are informative. Researchers have observed stepwise socioeconomic gradients in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, for 30 years (69, 92) and more recently in the United States (14,73,82). As seen in Figure 3, using U.S. data, overall and in multiple racial/ethnic groups, the improvements in health with increasing social advantage-measured here by income-generally follow a stepwise, incremental gradient pattern: Although the most disadvantaged-those with belowpoverty-level incomes or without high-school completion-typically experience the worst health, even those with intermediate income or education levels appear less healthy than the most affluent/educated (14). The social gradients in health provide clues to understanding the SDOH. Although other research is needed to clarify the underlying pathways, the dose-response relationship suggested by the gradient patterns supports the biological plausibility of a fundamental causal role for one or more upstream SDOH. Gradients by income, education, or occupational grade could reflect relatively direct health benefits of having more economic resources (e.g., healthier nutrition, housing, or neighborhood conditions, or less stress due to more resources to cope with daily challenges), unmeasured socioeconomic factors, and/or associated psychosocial/ behavioral factors, such as health-related behaviors (109), self-perceived social status (121), or perceived control (68). Reverse causation as an alternative explanation is discussed below.  ",
          "Following the framework depicted in Figure 2, we briefly review current knowledge of how several important upstream social factors influence health.",
          "Neighborhoods can influence health through their physical characteristics, such as air and water quality and proximity to facilities that produce or store hazardous substances; exposures to lead paint, mold, dust, or pest infestation in housing; access to nutritious foods and safe places to exercise; or risk of pedestrian accidents (6, 23,48,49,51,77,97). The availability and quality of neighborhood servicesincluding schools, transportation, medical care, and employment resources-can also influence health, e.g., by shaping residents' opportunities to earn a living (43,83,117). Neighborhoods' physical and service characteristics can create and reinforce socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health. Health is also shaped by social relationships. For example, neighborhoods where residents express mutual trust and are willing to intervene for the public good have been linked with lower homicide rates (76, 98); conversely, less closely knit neighborhoods and more social disorder have been related to anxiety and depression (32,84,94). Many-but not all-studies have found that neighborhood features are associated with health even after considering residents' individual-level characteristics (37). Surprisingly, some researchers-albeit not manyhave found poorer health among disadvantaged individuals living in relatively advantaged neighborhoods (85,89,120), possibly because of adverse psychological effects of feeling worse off than one's neighbors and/or stronger social ties or reduced exposure to discrimination associated with a greater geographic concentration of one's own group (119). Working conditions and health. The physical aspects of work-the traditional domain of occupational health and safety-represent an obvious pathway through which work influences health. For example, jobs requiring repetitive movements and/or high physical workload put workers at higher risk for musculoskeletal injuries and disorders (81), whereas physically inactive workers in sedentary jobs are at increased risk of obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (115); physical conditions in the workplace such as inadequate ventilation, high noise levels, and hazardous chemical exposures can also harm health. Psychosocial aspects of work represent another pathway to health. For example, working overtime has been associated with injury, illness, and mortality (20). Workers in jobs characterized by high demands coupled with low control or by perceived imbalance of efforts and rewards are at higher risk of poor health (34,56); control at work may be a major contributor to socioeconomic differences in health among employed persons (56,68). Social support at work has also been linked with health (104-107); environments facilitating mutual support among coworkers may buffer against physical and mental health stressors (60). Work-related opportunities and resources can also influence health. Employment-related earnings represent most Americans' primary economic resource, shaping health-related decisions made for themselves and their families; work-related benefits-including medical insurance, paid leave, schedule flexibility, workplace wellness programs, child-and elder-care resources and retirement benefits-could also be important. Well-paying jobs are more likely to provide benefits, greater financial security, and ability to afford healthier living conditions. In contrast, the working poor-estimated at 7.4 million U.S. workers in 2006 (112)-generally do not earn enough to cover basic necessities and are less likely to have health-related benefits (27,54). Different pathways linking work and health may interact to exacerbate social disparities in health: Socially disadvantaged groups Multiple pathways linking education to health. are more likely to have health-harming physical and psychosocial working conditions, along with disadvantaged living conditions associated with lower pay (38). Education and health. Figure 4 depicts three interrelated pathways through which educational attainment (completed schooling) is linked with health. It is widely recognized that education can lead to improved health by increasing health knowledge and healthy behaviors. This may be explained in part by literacy, allowing more-educated individuals to make better-informed, healthrelated decisions-including about receipt and management of medical care-for themselves and their families (36,99). Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors (3) and earlier adoption of health-related recommendations (31). Education also plays an important role in health by shaping employment opportunities, which are major determinants of economic resources. More-educated individuals experience lower rates of unemployment, which is strongly associated with worse health and higher mortality (4); they are more likely to have jobs with healthier physical and psychosocial working conditions, better health-related benefits (44), and higher compensation (30) (which determines affordability of health-promoting living conditions). Education may also affect health by influencing social and psychological factors. More education has been associated with greater perceived personal control (74), which has frequently been linked with better health and health-related behaviors (63,74,75). Greater educational attainment is generally associated with higher relative social standing; subjective social status (an individual's perception of his or her ranking in a social hierarchy) may predict health even after controlling for more objective indicators of social status (35). More education also has been linked with increased social support (72), which is associated with better physical and mental health (5); social support may buffer the health-damaging effects of stress (110), influence health-related behaviors (24), and if one's social networks are socially advantaged, enhance access to employment, housing, and other opportunities and resources that can influence health (19). The role of educational quality-e.g., the employment opportunities, prestige, social networks, and other advantages accompanying a degree from an elite institution-is rarely considered in health studies. Educational attainment thus can underestimate health-related differences related to education (75,95). Income, wealth, and health. Economic resources reflect access to material goods and services, including income (monetary earnings during a specified time period) and wealth (accumulated material assets, such as the value of one's home, household possessions, vehicles and other property, bank accounts, and investments). Theoretically, wealth may better reflect economic resources overall, but it is more difficult to measure than income and hence less frequently measured in health studies. Among studies that have included both, many (but not all) have found links between wealth and health after considering income (87). Racial/ethnic differences in income markedly underestimate differences in wealth (13). Reverse causation (income loss due to poor health) occurs but does not fully account for the observed associations of income/wealth and health (58,78). Many longitudinal studies show that economic resources predict health or its proximate determinants, even after adjustment for education (2, 33, 52) [although education is a stronger predictor for other outcomes (52) and both are likely to matter (13, 58)]. Health effects of increasing income have been observed in randomized and natural experiments (58). Several researchers have observed health effects of income/wealth even after adjusting for many other relevant factors (33,58,62). Particularly when other socioeconomic factors are inadequately measured, however, observed associations between income/wealth and health may reflect effects of other socioeconomically linked factors such as educational attainment and quality, childhood socioeconomic circumstances, neighborhood characteristics, physical and psychosocial working conditions, and subjective social status. The health effects of low economic resources may be ameliorated by access to other resources and opportunities; for example, some relatively low-income countries/states (e.g., Cuba, Costa Rica, and Kerala, India) have favorable health indicators that may be explained by long-standing societal investments in education, social safety nets, and/or prevention-oriented medical care (41). Income inequality (measured at an aggregate level) has often been linked with health (116), although a causal link is debated (65,116). Income inequality could affect health by eroding social cohesion (59). The link could also be explained by other factors strongly associated with both income inequality and health, such as lack of social solidarity, which could be both a cause and an effect of income inequality. Race, racism, and health. In the United States and many other societies, race or ethnic group is another important social factor that influences health, primarily because of racism. Racism refers not only to overt, intentionally discriminatory actions and attitudes, but also to deep-seated societal structures that-even without intent to discriminate-systematically constrain some individuals' opportunities and resources on the basis of their race or ethnic group. Racial residential segregation is a key mechanism through which racism produces and perpetuates social disadvantage (22,117). Blacks and Latinos are more likely to reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods with inadequately resourced schools and hence to have lower educational attainment and quality Racial discrimination, racism: includes societal structures, such as residential segregation and social networks, that systematically perpetuate social disadvantage along racial or ethnic lines, even without conscious intent to discriminate (96), with resultant health effects through pathways discussed above. Racism may also affect health more directly through pathways involving stress; chronic stress related to experiences of racial/ethnic bias, including relatively subtle experiences arising even without consciously prejudicial intent, may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health, regardless of one's neighborhood, income, or education (80,118). More education or income may paradoxically expose blacks or Latinos to more discrimination because of more contact with (non-Latino) whites. Race-health links could also be shaped by perceptions of how one's race-and its associations with social influence, prestige, and acceptance-affects one's relative place in social hierarchies. Associations between discrimination and health similar to those observed in the United States are being found in other countries (118). The pervasive role of stress. Coping with daily challenges can be particularly stressful when one's financial and social resources are limited. Recent evidence implicates chronic stress in the causal pathways linking multiple upstream social determinants with health, through neuroendocrine, inflammatory, immune, and/or vascular mechanisms (71,108). Stressful experiences-such as those associated with social disadvantage, including economic hardship (12, 40) and racial discrimination (118)-may trigger the release of cortisol, cytokines, and other substances that can damage immune defenses, vital organs, and physiologic systems (71,101). This mechanism can lead to more rapid onset or progression of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease (108), and the bodily wear and tear associated with chronic stress may accelerate aging (70,102,103). The accumulated strain from trying, with inadequate resources, to cope with daily challenges may, over time, lead to more physiological damage than would a single dramatically stressful event (70). A recent collection of papers summarizes current knowledge of pathways and biological mechanisms likely to be involved in the health effects of stress and other psychosocial factorsincluding perceived control, subjective social status, and social support (1).",
          "The importance of early childhood experiences. Among the strongest bodies of SDOH evidence is work considering adverse health effects of early childhood experiences associated with family social disadvantage. Many studies have shown that early experiences affect children's cognitive, behavioral, and physical development (7, 25, 53, 55), which predicts health; developmental differences have been associated with socioeconomically linked differences in children's home environments, including differences in stimulation from parents/caregivers (7, 39,50,114,123). Biological changes due to adverse socioeconomic conditions in infancy and toddler years appear to become \"embedded\" in children's bodies, determining their developmental capacity (53). Several longitudinal studies following children from early childhood through young adulthood have linked childhood developmental outcomes with subsequent educational attainment (18,47,100), which is strongly associated with adult health (discussed above). Substantial evidence indicates that pathways initiated by childhood adversity can be interrupted. Studies show that high-quality early childhood development interventionsincluding center-based programs to nurture and stimulate children and to support and educate parents-greatly ameliorate the effects of social disadvantage on children's cognitive, emotional/behavioral, and physical development (57); the first five years of life appear to be most crucial (55), although opportunities for intervention continue throughout childhood (55) and adolescence (42). over lifetimes and across generations (9, 26,40,45,46,53,55,64,66,102,108,124). As illustrated in Figure 5, developed for the RWJF Commission, upstream social factors influence health at each life stage, with accumulating social advantage/disadvantage and health advantage/disadvantage over time. Children of socially disadvantaged parents are less healthy and have more limited educational opportunities, both of which diminish their chances for good health and social advantage in adulthood. Emerging research on geneenvironment interactions suggests that the intergenerational transmission of social advantage and health may be partially explained by epigenetic changes in gene expression, which in turn are passed on to subsequent generations (61).",

          "A large body of evidence from observational research strongly and repeatedly links multiple upstream social (including economic) factors with a wide array of health outcomes, and understanding-albeit incomplete-of underlying pathways and biological mechanisms has been growing. With notable exceptions, however, we know little about effective ways to address social factors to improve health and reduce health disparities-about when, where, and how to intervene. The gaps in knowledge reflect several challenges. More often than not, the relationships between upstream social factors and health are complex and play out over long periods of time, involving multiple intermediate outcomes subject to effect modification by characteristics of people and settings along the causal chain. This complexity makes it difficult to learn about the specific pathways through which upstream social factors shape health and to identify priorities for intervention. Addressing the knowledge gaps is also complicated by our limited ability to measure upstream social factors. Current measures do not fully capture-or tease out the distinct effects of-relevant aspects of income, wealth, education, or occupational rank. For example, the observed effects of race/ethnicity on adult health after adjustment for available socioeconomic measures suggest a potential role for unmeasured social influences (13)e.g., childhood circumstances, neighborhood characteristics, accumulated wealth, racial discrimination. Development of better measures of these influences is in its infancy (13,37,80,118). Research funding is also an issue. Most U.S. research funding supports studies of single diseases rather than causal or contributory factors with effects that manifest across multiple diseases, putting SDOH research at a disadvantage. The health effects of upstream social factors-or interventions to address themmay not manifest for decades or generations; longitudinal studies are expensive and access to longitudinal databases is particularly limited in the United States (9). Conducting randomized trials, the gold standard for establishing effectiveness in health sciences, is particularly challenging for upstream interventions.",
          "Investment at this time would be particularly strategic in several areas. Research to improve the measurement of social factors is an important requisite for effective efforts in all of the following areas. Descriptive studies and monitoring. Ongoing descriptive research is needed to monitor changes over time both in the distributions of key upstream social factors (e.g., income, wealth, and education) across groups defined by race/ethnicity, geography, and gender, and in their associations with health outcomes in specific populations and settings. Interpreted in light of relevant policies, these findings can indicate the extent to which social and health disadvantage affects different groups and gauge progress toward improving health and reducing health disparities. Longitudinal research. We need more life-course research, including longitudinal studies to build public-use databases with comprehensive information on both social factors and health, collected over time frames long enough-ideally multiple generations-for health consequences of early childhood experiences to manifest. A more reasonable balance is needed between investments in studying adult disease and examining children's trajectories of health and social advantage across the life course. Connecting the dots: linking knowledge to elucidate pathways and assess interventions. Even robust longitudinal data are unlikely to provide sufficient information for tracing the effects of an upstream determinant (A) through relevant pathways to its ultimate health outcomes (Z), particularly if exposure to A occurs in childhood and outcome Z occurs much later. Attempting to document and quantify the effects of A on Z in a single study represents an important obstacle to understanding how social factors influence health-and how to intervene. Considering the potential for effect modification by characteristics of people and contexts at each step of multiple complex causal pathways, the consistency of existing findings linking upstream social determinants with distal health outcomes seems remarkable. To strengthen our understanding of how upstream social factors shape health, we need to connect the dots by building the knowledge base incrementally through linking a series of distinct studies (perhaps spanning multiple disciplines) that examine specific segments of the pathways connecting A to Z. For example, one study could test the effects of an upstream determinant on an intermediate outcome, which then could be the independent variable in subsequent studies of increasingly downstream intermediate outcomes; no single study would be expected to span all steps from A to Z. Once the links in the causal chain are documented, a similar incremental approach could be applied to study the effectiveness of interventions, e.g., testing the effects of an upstream intervention on an intermediate outcome with established links to health. This approach to advancing knowledge is not new: Medicine and public health often rely on evidence from studies of intermediate outcomes (e.g., obesity) with demonstrated links to other outcomes (e.g., diabetes or cardiovascular disease) (11). Although not definitive, the knowledge gained from connecting the dots can be compelling when confirmed in multiple studies; furthermore, policy makers must recognize that the limited generalizability of findings from randomized experiments introduces uncertainty as well (11).",
          "We need research to inform translation of existing knowledge about the SDOH into effective and efficient policies. Often, the rate-limiting step may not be insufficient knowledge of pathways but rather lack of solid evidence about what, specifically and concretely, works best in different settings to reduce social inequalities in health. For example, although we have convincing evidence that educational quality and attainment powerfully influence health through multiple pathways, lack of consensus about interventions is often invoked to justify inaction. Knowledge of pathways can point to promising or at least plausible approaches but generally cannot indicate which actions will be effective and efficient under different conditions; that knowledge can come only from well-designed intervention research, including both randomized experiments (when possible and appropriate) and nonrandomized studies with rigorous attention to comparability and bias. Intervention research often seeks to identify the magic bullet that will yield results on its own, a stand-alone intervention with independent effects after adjusting for other factors. This notion may be reasonable when considering surgery, but the complex pathways linking social disadvantage to health suggest that seeking a single magic bullet is unrealistic. Interventions with individuals may require simultaneous efforts with families and communities. Recognizing the expense and methodologic challenges, we need multifaceted approaches that operate simultaneously across domains to interrupt damaging (and activate favorable) pathways at multiple points at which the underlying differences in social advantage and the consequent health inequalities are produced, exacerbated, and perpetuated. Other issues must also be addressed. Research funding must be expanded beyond a focus on single diseases and/or biomedical factors exclusively. The time frame for evaluating program or policy effectiveness should be extended (11). Researchers must be trained in the concepts, measures, and methods needed both to study SDOH and their interactions with biomedical factors (e.g., gene-environment interactions) and to consider social factors in clinical and laboratory studies focused on other questions. Political barriers to translating knowledge to action. The field of SDOH is coming of age in many ways, with respect to increased attention within and beyond academia; documentation of strong and pervasive links between social and economic factors and health; and the accumulation of knowledge of pathways and biological mechanisms that provide a scientific foundation for appreciating the role of social factors in health. Although associations between social factors and health are no longer in question, we have much to learn, both about the underlying processes linking upstream social determinants and most health outcomes and about effective ways to intervene. Lack of evidence, however, is not always the major barrier to action. Often, the chief obstacle is lack of political will; particularly in the United States, our deeply embedded culture of individualism can impede actions that require a sense of social solidarity. For example, as noted in an Institute of Medicine report, \"whether early childhood programs can make a difference has been asked and answered in the affirmative innumerable times\"; the remaining questions are about the most effective and efficient interventions (55). Even after major business groups have advocated universal highquality preschool as essential for achieving a productive-i.e., healthy and educated-future workforce (16,28,86), this goal remains elusive. Descriptive, explanatory, and interventional research can play a supportive role in building consensus about the need for action by increasing public and policy-maker awareness of unacceptable conditions such as racial and socioeconomic disparities in health; by making the links between social factors and health meaningful and plausible to the public and policy makers; and by suggesting, testing, and helping to estimate the costs of promising science-based approaches. Information about the pathways and mechanisms through which social advantage influences health can provide an important counterweight to victim-blaming, which too often impedes policies focused on upstream social and economic factors. Based on current understanding of the role of stress in the links between multiple social factors and health outcomes, studies of pathways involving stressful circumstances and physiological responses to stress may yield knowledge needed to help achieve consensus for action. Research on the SDOH can provide practical guidance for policies and add meaning and credibility to ethical and economic arguments for the need to act, not only to ameliorate the adverse health consequences but also to reduce social disadvantage itself.",
          "1. A critical mass of knowledge related to the social determinants of health has accumulated in the United States and elsewhere, documenting associations, exploring pathways and biological mechanisms, and providing a previously unavailable scientific foundation for appreciating the fundamental role of social factors in health. 2. The questions are no longer about whether social factors are important influences on health, but rather about how social factors operate and how we can most effectively intervene to activate health-promoting pathways and interrupt health-damaging ones. 3. Too little attention has been given to the upstream social determinants of health, such as economic resources, education, and racial discrimination. Although most research has focused on the more easily studied and addressed downstream factors, these upstream determinants represent the fundamental causes in pathways that influence downstream factors and ultimately lead to health effects. 4. One barrier to expanding our understanding of how upstream social determinants influence health is a widespread expectation that a single research study can encompass an entire pathway from upstream factor to downstream health effects. Such studies are unlikely to be achieved, however, given the complex causal chains and long time periods involved. Rather, we should focus on advancing knowledge of pathways incrementally by linking results from studies of specific pathway segments. 5. More research on pathways and biological mechanisms is needed, but this will not necessarily yield sufficient information for identifying the most effective and efficient interventions. Well-designed studies of interventions are essential. 6. On the basis of experience and awareness of the complexity of pathways, isolated interventions focused on single discrete (upstream or downstream) social factors may not be effective. The challenge is to design and adequately study multidimensional interventions that address multiple factors simultaneously. 7. Lack of evidence is not always the major barrier to action on the social determinants of health. Particularly in the United States, the crucial obstacle is often lack of political will. A strategic research agenda on the social determinants of health should also address the factors that can enhance or impede political will to translate knowledge into effective action.",

          "The Power of Political Rhetoric RONALD R. KREBS University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA PATRICK THADDEUS JACKSON American University, Washington, DC, USA While scholars of International Relations and comparative politics have usually treated rhetoric as epiphenomenal, one strand of constructivism has recently returned rhetoric to the heart of political analysis, especially through the mechanism of persuasion. We too maintain that rhetoric is central to political processes and outcomes, but we argue that persuasion is theoretically and methodologically problematic. We aver that rhetoric's role may be more usefully conceptualized in the context of coercion, and we advance a stylized model that illustrates how rhetorical coercion operates, explains why it works, and identifies key scope conditions. We subsequently illustrate our model's relevance through a detailed examination of a 'hard' case. This article's agenda is twofold. First, it advises scholars in these fields to avoid focusing on unanswerable questions about actors' motives and to examine instead what actors say, in what contexts, and to what audiences. Second, it lays the groundwork for a 'coercive constructivism', complementing the liberal version so prevalent today. KEY WORDS ♦ coercion ♦ constructivism ♦ discourse ♦ Habermas ♦ Israel ♦ military service ♦ persuasion ♦ rhetoric Talk is often thought to belong to the realm of diplomacy, war to the realm of action. Yet, during the 2003 Iraq War, the Bush administration was nearly as preoccupied with how the combat was portrayed as with the combat itself. Its foreign policy team invariably spoke of coalition forces rather than American forces, the war to liberate Iraq rather than the invasion of Iraq, Saddam's death squads rather than Saddam's fedayeen. Rhetoric is central to politics, even when politics takes the form of war. Yet rhetoric is curiously not central to much scholarship in comparative politics and International Relations. Politics is typically marked by rhetorical competition, but our theoretical frameworks are generally hard-pressed to make sense of its dynamics and outcomes. Whereas the dominant materialist tradition treats rhetoric as epiphenomenal, we argue, following recent constructivist work, that the rhetorical interplay itself provides leverage in explaining outcomes. We are less comfortable, however, with the argument advanced by some constructivists that political actors deploy resonant rhetorical forms and thereby persuade their interlocutors of the correctness of their preferred course of action. Although persuasion undoubtedly does occur in the political arena, it is also rare. Moreover, such mechanisms rest on a strong specification of the subjective motivations of individuals and thus are methodologically intractable. Recent mainstream constructivist research has prompted a refreshing debate on and advanced our understanding of political deliberation and argumentation. By focusing on internalized norms as the driving forces of behavior and policy, however, such research has ultimately diverted attention from the dynamics of rhetoric. Persuasion does not exhaust the ways through which rhetoric might shape political contest. In particular, we would call attention to culturalist approaches that concentrate on observable rhetorical contests, on narrative and language games. Drawing on this tradition as well as the broad insights of the field of political communication, we propose a model of 'rhetorical coercion' as an alternative means of conceptualizing the place of rhetoric in politics. 1  Employing an expansive definition of rhetoric that includes all speech actswhether they are oral or written, whether they take place under conditions approximating Habermas' 'ideal speech situation' or not -we argue that rhetorical maneuver can prove critical to success in political contests even when one's opponents have not internalized the promoted values. While claimants may deploy arguments in the hope that they will eventually persuade, their more immediate task is, through skillful framing, to leave their opponents without access to the rhetorical materials needed to craft a socially sustainable rebuttal. Rhetorical coercion occurs when this strategy proves successful: when the claimant's opponents have been talked into a corner, compelled to endorse a stance they would otherwise reject. Most narrowly conceived, this article suggests and explores a language-focused mechanism of political influence complementing recent scholarship, but it also has a broader agenda. At the level of methodology, it calls on mainstream scholarship to avoid centering causal accounts on unanswerable questions about actors' true motives and to focus instead on what actors say, in what contexts, and to what audiences. At the level of substantive theory, it joins European Journal of International Relations 13(1) other recent work in returning rhetoric to the heart of political analysis. But rhetoric is often both the medium and the locus of political contest, and thus focusing on its role in the context of deliberation can take us only so far. Rhetoric matters, we argue, when human beings power as well as when they puzzle. This article represents a step away from constructivism with a liberal flavor, focused on the transformation of values, toward constructivism with coercive characteristics, focused on the exercise of power. This article proceeds in four main sections. First, we critically review existing approaches to rhetoric in empirical political science, examining in particular the limitations of (liberal or deliberative) constructivist approaches premised on persuasion. Second, we set forth our generalizable mechanism of rhetorical coercion and explicate both its logic and its limits. Third, we illustrate this mechanism's operation by exploring in detail a single 'hard' case: the relatively successful efforts of Druze Arabs in Israel to garner greater citizenship rights by framing them as the just deserts of their military sacrifice. This outcome is not entirely explicable without close attention to the dynamics of competing rhetorical claims, and our model of rhetorical coercion helps make sense of this puzzling and important case. Fourth, we briefly discuss the particular possibilities and limits of rhetorical coercion within international politics.",
          "Most scholars of international and comparative politics disparage rhetoric as epiphenomenal. The very phrase 'mere rhetoric' captures the view that what counts is not the language people use but the material power resources upon which they can draw. This perspective is shared by 'realist' (and especially rationalist) writers, and it accords with a well-established understanding of political power. Disenchanted with narrow materialist approaches, some have in recent years sought to harness the power of ideas. Many have invoked beliefs, ideas, and culture to supply inputs and to serve as coordination devices in games with multiple equilibria (Goldstein and Keohane, 1993;Laitin, 1998). Political psychologists have long argued that ideas influence how actors interpret evidence and sift through information (Jervis, 1976). Students of collective action have suggested that principled commitments can motivate participants and render them unusually insensitive to the costs of protest (Cohen, 1985). However, scholars with an ideational bent have typically relegated rhetoric to the margins. For 'idealists', words matter only insofar as they reflect actors' true beliefs, with private statements seen as more revealing than public pronouncements. Public rhetoric is of causal consequence only from the top down, as leaders of states and social movements deploy resonant language in an effort to mobilize support (Edelman, 1964;Snow et al., 1986;Snow and Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms Benford, 1988). While devotees of 'interests' and 'ideas' vigorously debate the relative causal power of their favored variables, scholars in both traditions have little use for public rhetorical contestation. But to treat rhetoric as epiphenomenal is to render much of politics puzzling and to do violence to politics as lived by its participants. Rhetoric is certainly a weapon of the weak, but those holding the reins of power can and must deploy it as well. The acquisition and maintenance of rule ultimately hinge as much on legitimacy as on physical coercion, and such legitimacy can be established only through rhetorical action (Weber, 1968). While political contestants unquestionably further their agenda by exploiting material resources, they generally at the same time 'frame' their political activity, explaining the purposes to which their material power is put (Gamson, 1992). Such contests among state leaders and societal activists should be at the center of the study of politics. Rationalists and political psychologists might both protest that they have done precisely this. Rationalist scholars have pointed out that talk is not always cheap. State leaders who renege on their public rhetorical commitments may bear substantial domestic and international costs, giving them incentives both to tell the truth and to strategically manipulate audience costs (Fearon, 1994;Sartori, 2002). Though important, this insight flattens rhetoric into a purely informational tool, a way of efficiently revealing whether one is a high-cost or low-cost actor. As such, it cannot shed light on the framing competitions that often lie at the heart of politics. Political psychologists working within the area of political communication have demonstrated that speakers who succeed in defining the relevant considerations can shape mass opinion and ultimately policy outcomes. 2 But nearly all framing experiments have abstracted far from reality in exposing subjects to just a single issue frame (Druckman, 2001). Even the exceptions have failed to interrogate fully the dynamics of framing. Recent studies have concluded that the framing effect disappears when targets are exposed to competing frames from equally credible sources and that targets then respond in accord with supposedly invariant preferences (Druckman, 2004;Sniderman and Theriault, 2004). By this account, the intense framing contests endemic to politics are peripheral in that their only effect (given the caveat of equal credibility) is to render frame competition inconsequential, and baffling in that actors continue to expend copious resources on their rhetorical efforts. Moreover, this research program has ironically diverted attention from rhetorical interplay and instead directed it towards attributes of the target (e.g. political knowledge, awareness, expertise) and the source (e.g. credibility, trustworthiness, expert status). Studies of 'message effects' are comparatively rare. 3 Our debt to the psychological literature on framing is clear, but we wish to bring rhetoric itself back into the heart of the analysis.",
          "Most approaches fail to accord public rhetoric per se causal status, but one major exception has been the vibrant constructivist literature in international and comparative politics (Checkel, 1998;Finnemore and Sikkink, 2001). A central problem for constructivists has been explaining how and why new norms emerge and why actors might obey norms despite contrary material pressures. 4 Among the universe of mechanisms through which political actors develop 'shared understandings', and arguably occupying pride of place, is persuasion: 'normative claims ', Finnemore (1996: 141) asserts, 'become powerful and prevail by being persuasive' (see also Payne, 2001;Johnston, 2001). The targets of persuasive rhetorical moves do not grudgingly comply, but rather sincerely internalize new beliefs and consequently adopt new identities and preferences. Through persuasion, 'agent action becomes social structure, ideas become norms, and the subjective becomes the intersubjective' (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998: 914). Through persuasive rhetoric, national and transnational social movements prompt not merely compliance with but consent to existing norms, and norm entrepreneurs need not resort to coercion to effect change. Persuasion -and public rhetoric as its medium -have emerged as the coins of the constructivist realm (see, among many others, Checkel, 2001;Crawford, 2002;Keck and Sikkink, 1998;Risse et al., 1999;Risse, 2000). Though sometimes only implicitly, these scholars have often drawn on Jürgen Habermas' logic of 'communicative action' to explain the power of rhetoric (Johnson, 1993;Lynch, 1999Lynch, , 2002;;Müller, 2001;Risse, 2000). 5  Habermas acknowledges that political actors often engage in narrowly goaldirected (teleological) action, but what makes his political vision distinctive is its affirmation of the possibility and prevalence of rational dialogue, of openminded deliberation in the quest for truth. Every legitimate use of language, Habermas argues, is premised on mutual understandings, on 'idealizations that transcend any particular language game', and these 'give rise to the perspective of an agreement that is open to criticism on the basis of validity claims' (Habermas, 1990: 199). For Habermas, politics (at least in its ideal form) is less about contest than consensus, less about powering than puzzling, and deliberative exchange consequently takes center stage (Habermas, 1984). Ideally, actors leave power and rank at the door, and they seek to persuade others and are themselves open to persuasion. Experimental studies of deliberation in fact conclude that the key to sustaining reflective discussion lies in the willingness of participants to keep an open mind (Barabas, 2004). We are very much in sympathy with this emphasis on public rhetorical interchange, but we are skeptical as to the utility of privileging persuasion as a causal mechanism. As Habermas himself recognizes, the unconstrained dialogue of 'communicative action' is not an empirically accurate portrait of politics, for power and rank are omnipresent in the political sphere. Actors do not leave their identities at the door when entering into dialogue, and they do not employ language unadulterated by earlier political contestation. Discourse is therefore always structured -and not by reason alone. Rules of exclusion and employment dictate what arguments can be proffered, under what conditions, and by whom (Foucault, 1972). Insofar as empirically oriented constructivists invoke 'communicative action' to explain real-world processes, it is fair to ask whether rational deliberation characterizes actual political debate. Only on the rare occasions when it does can Habermasian discourse ethics yield empirical insight into political contestation. It would, therefore, seem more helpful to adopt a theoretical framework that explicates the power of rhetoric even when politics is not truth-seeking and truth-generating, and a conception of rhetoric that includes all speech, no matter how interlaced with power relations. We are also skeptical that analysts can overcome the methodological hurdles standing in the way of demonstrating that persuasion has occurred. Such an explanation presumes that one can pin down the 'real motives' driving individual choice, so that one can distinguish beliefs sincerely embraced from those adopted for strategic or other reasons (Payne, 2001: 39-41). But conclusive proof of persuasion is elusive, for it requires unmediated access to people's minds (Wittgenstein, 1953: §150-5). Did Gorbachev accede to the reunification of Germany because he had been persuaded by the trump card of self-determination (Risse, 2000) or because he had calculated that the net costs of resisting the United States were prohibitive? Did Europeans abandon their overseas colonies because they had been persuaded that formal empire was illegitimate (Crawford, 2002) or because they had calculated that the net expected costs of retaining the colonies were excessive? It is impossible to say based on the available evidence, nor is it clear what evidence could even in principle clinch the case. 6 Relying on statements delivered in private settings does not escape the problem, since these articulations may be as strategic as their public counterparts (Scott, 1990). Many of these questions have received attention elsewhere. Scholars of transnational activism have drawn attention to the 'mobilization of shame', and they too have concluded that ways of framing claims cannot be fabricated out of whole cloth (Crawford, 2002;Price, 1998Price, , 2003;;Risse and Sikkink, 1999). Elements of William Riker's suggestive work on 'heresthetics ' (1996) are apropos, as is Frank Schimmelfenig's research on 'rhetorical action ' (2004). We seek to build on and systematize these important contributions, but we also depart from them. First, while many constructivists recognize that the targets of activist efforts may comply at first for strategic reasons, they claim that lasting normative change requires internalization. 7 This formulation is problematic because it relies on incompatible microfoundations in stage one (instrumental adaptation) and stage two (internalization). On methodological grounds, we prefer a mechanism of political influence highlighting strategic European Journal of International Relations 13(1) action throughout the entire episode. We agree with Weber that consistency, not completeness, should be the hallmark of sound work in the social sciences (Weber, 1949). Further, we are reluctant to characterize any normative change as 'lasting' in the sense of forestalling normative contestation over the long run. We proceed from the premise that norms are inherently subject to challenge and that the rhetorical arrangements sustaining norms are never fully stabilized and are at best relatively stable. Rhetorical contestation is thus always possible in theory, although it may not always be manifest in practice. Consequently, we focus on specific bounded episodes of contestation (McAdam et al., 2001: 29-30). Finally, existing accounts focusing on the strategic uses of public language -both constructivist (e.g. Risse, 2000) and rationalist (e.g. Riker, 1996)continue to be crafted around assertions about the 'interests' served by various rhetorical deployments and the 'motives' driving both speakers and targets. We seek to place the mechanism of rhetorical coercion on firmer methodological footing and, more broadly, to demonstrate the viability of a non-purposive social science. 8 Our skepticism regarding explanations rooted in the identification of motives is not novel. Hans Morgenthau, for one, declared the search for statesmen's motives 'futile' because 'motives are the most illusive of psychological data' (Morgenthau, 1993(Morgenthau, [1948]]: 5). Scholars in the rationalchoice tradition have offered similar observations (Frieden, 1999). Our 'solution', however, is more controversial. We are not prepared to follow our rational-choice colleagues down the path of assuming and deducing preferences. Rather, we take a less-traveled road and argue that social scientists should not begin by specifying the intentions of actors. Let us be clear: we are not arguing that actors do not possess motives, that those motives do not shape actors' behavior, or that such behavior is irrelevant to political outcomes. But we do aver that purposive accounts are analytically less useful than models in which preferences need not be specified or ranked. We therefore seek to minimize the place of motives as driving forces in our accounts of political processes and outcomes. We do not recommend this course lightly, for it flies in the face of deeply held epistemological commitments among social scientists in general and political scientists in particular. Purging empirical narratives of the language of subjective motivation is consequently difficult indeed. 9 Moreover, we recognize that all methodological choices are problematic, since the modeling of complex social processes requires abstracting from reality. Yet while this path is less traveled, it is by no means virgin ground. Many social scientists have distanced themselves from subjectivist understandings of culture as a coherent system of beliefs that might be ascertained through sophisticated survey techniques. We, like they, conceptualize culture as the always contested and often contradictory intersubjective semiotic practices through which social actors seek to generate meaning (Ross, 1997;Wedeen, 2002). Public semiotic codes constrain social actors regardless of whether they truly 'believe' in these codes' content, and thus the question of 'actual' belief is of little relevance (Weber, 1968;Jackson, 2002). Relational sociologists, most notably Charles Tilly, have maintained that individualist approaches commit the sin of reductionism: even if we did know people's motives, that would not help us explain social processes and outcomes. We follow these scholars in avoiding individual consciousness as a causal factor and in shifting 'the emphasis from consciousness to conversation, from action to interaction, from selves to sociabilities' (Tilly, 1998: 400; see also Emirbayer, 1997;and Shotter, 1993). These foundational theoretical moves serve as the point of departure for our model of rhetorical coercion. 10 We cannot observe directly what people think, but we can observe what they say and how they respond to claims and counter-claims. In our view, it does not matter whether actors believe what they say, whether they are motivated by crass material interests or sincere commitment. What is important is that they can be rhetorically maneuvered into a corner, trapped into publicly endorsing positions they may, or may not, find anathema. Rhetoric affects political outcomes even when all actors are cynical operators with little interest in genuine deliberation. The resolution of political issues through public debate need not imply any significant level of intersubjective consensus. Thinking about public rhetoric in this fashion avoids the crudeness of vulgar materialism, the reductionism of ideational approaches, and the heroic optimism of persuasion. Our perspective, which one might term 'coercive constructivism', both relates to and is different from existing approaches. Unlike both materialist and ideational accounts, we argue that language has a real causal impact on political outcomes. Unlike ideational approaches and liberal constructivism, we are skeptical that politics is more often characterized by puzzling than powering; we are equally skeptical that actors can transcend coercion and participate in fully rational deliberation. 11",
          "Rhetoric lies at the heart of politics. But many accounts of politics fail to accord it much weight, and many models fail to appreciate its explanatory leverage. This section seeks to explain how and why skillful rhetorical maneuvering can underpin a successful political campaign -not by persuading one's opponents of the rectitude of one's stance, but by denying them the rhetorical materials out of which to craft a socially sustainable rebuttal. Rhetorical coercion is a political strategy that seeks to twist arms by twisting tongues. This section proceeds by clarifying what rhetorical coercion is, how it operates, and the conditions under which it can be effective.",
          "We begin with a stylized account of an episode of rhetorical contestation. Seeking to effect change in some policy or ongoing course of action, a claimant (C) directs an argument toward the opposition (O) in view of a public (P). For the purposes of the model, it does not matter whether O has exclusive control over the actions at issue (if O is, for example, the government) or whether C and O share responsibility (if they are, for example, political parties in a legislative assembly). All that matters is that O's accession or resistance is critical to the outcome. Any argument that C puts forward contains two analytically separable parts: a frame (or set of terms) that characterizes the issue at hand and a set of implications that C suggests follows from that frame. For example, C might be a group of students protesting a war; their argument, advanced against the national government O through speeches and signs at a rally, portrays the war both to O and to P as unjust and unnecessary (frame) and calls for the end of hostilities and the withdrawal of troops (implications). In responding to C, O may accept or reject either or both the frame and the implications of C's argument. These alternatives yield four different potential outcomes of this episode of political contestation, reflected in Table 1. In case 1, O accepts both the frame and the implications of C's argument, and policy changes accordingly. 12 For C, this outcome represents an unmitigated triumph. Case 2 is more mixed. In case 2, O accepts the proposed implications and changes the policy, but it rejects C's reasoning. An example would be if an environmental movement (C) urged the government (O) to restrict logging for ecological reasons, and the government agreed to restrict logging but justified the policy shift in economic terms. Though the movement would have won the substantive battle, it might reasonably perceive its victory as less than complete; the government might in the future expand logging rights on economic grounds as easily as it had earlier restricted them on that very basis. It is possible that the environmentalists' rhetorical tactics drove the government's concessions, but determining that would require Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and  access to the authorities' true motives -something we earlier argued one can never ascertain. Both case 1 and case 2 mark (at least temporary) terminuses; contestation might resume at a later stage, but these cells represent relatively stable outcomes in the short to medium run. In contrast, cases 3 and 4 are cases of continued contestation. In case 3, O accepts the terms of C's arguments, but rejects the implications that C draws. For example, a lobbying group (C) may argue that high taxes are an unfair burden on the citizenry and should be reduced through an across-the-board reduction in tax rates; a political party (O) may agree that high taxes are problematic but suggest instead targeted tax cuts. As this relatively narrow policy debate occurs within a common issue frame, it might be termed an implication contest. In case 4, the two parties disagree about the very terms of debate as well as the policies that follow, and their rhetorical efforts consequently focus on advancing their preferred issue frame in the hope that their political opponents will accept it (along with the concomitant implications). Without a common frame bounding the debate, such rhetorical interchange -a framing contestis far more fluid, wide-ranging, and fundamental than in an implication contest. Politics is replete with such framing contests. Advocates of bilingual instruction invoke diversity and inter-cultural respect, while critics charge that instruction in anything other than the dominant language would threaten national ideals and students' eventual success in the marketplace. Opponents of abortion call the fetus an unborn child, portray the act as murder, and label themselves defenders of the right to life; supporters of abortion rights depict the fetus as an insentient being, portray the act as a medical procedure, and dub themselves the defenders of a woman's right to choose. Engaged in either an implication contest or a framing contest, C seeks through its claims and counter-claims to alter the rhetorical environment within which political battle is waged. While C might ideally prefer to persuade O, it must design a political strategy that can attain its desired ends even if persuasion proves impossible. The public plays a crucial role: both C and O must craft their appeals with an eye to some audience which sits in judgment of their rhetorical moves. If C can shift the rhetorical basis on which O justifies its stance to P, C can limit the range of O's possible responses and policy options, transcending the erstwhile implication or framing contest. Put simply, rhetorical coercion has taken place when this strategy proves successful -when O, regardless of its private beliefs, can no longer sustain its public opposition.",
          "Rhetorical contestation consists of parties attempting to maneuver each other onto more favorable rhetorical terrain and thereby to close off routes of European Journal of International Relations 13(1) acceptable rebuttal. Rhetorical coercion is successful when C's rhetorical moves deprive O of materials out of which to craft a reply that falls within the bounds of what P would accept. In the end, O finds itself, against its better judgment, endorsing (or at least acquiescing in) C's stance regardless of whether O has been persuaded or believes the words it utters. The alternatives -enduring punishment at the hands of P or investing significant resources in creating new terms of debate -would be prohibitively costly and time-consuming. In our model of rhetorical coercion, neither the motives nor the sincerity of the parties is particularly relevant. 13  C can succeed in rhetorically coercing O because of two key facts of social life. First, political actors can rarely take tangible steps or advance policy positions without justifying those stances and behaviors -in short, without framing. Politics may entail coercion or distribution, but at the same time it involves the struggle over meanings. Meanings, however, cannot be imposed unilaterally or through the exercise of material power alone. They are, by their very nature, intersubjective (Laffey and Weldes, 1997), and the effort to forge shared meaning implicates some audience in the process. The debate between C and O does not transpire in a vacuum: both are continually striving to legitimate their positions in P's eyes (Perelman, 1982). Second, speakers may not say just anything they would like in the public arena: rhetoric is not infinitely elastic but is structured. 14 Every community of discourse shares a number of topoi, or rhetorical commonplaces, that both enable and constrain speakers' rhetorical possibilities. These commonplaces are not 'fully predetermined, already decided distinctions', but weakly shared notions that can be 'expressed or formulated in different ways in different, concrete circumstances' (Shotter, 1993: 170-1). While C and O are free to weave together these commonplaces in creative ways, they are not free to deploy utterly alien formulations in the course of contestation: such arguments would fall, almost literally, on deaf ears. The available space for rhetorical contestation is, therefore, locally bounded, and the parties to a contentious episode cannot introduce entirely novel arguments. They must configure their appeals utilizing rhetorical tools drawn from a chest that is, in the short term, effectively fixed (Swidler, 1986). Rhetorical innovation, while possible and even inevitable in the long run, is far less likely in the short run for three reasons. First, while structures of discourse are never fully hegemonic and are continually being reworked, coherent political action would be impossible if rhetorical universes were in a state of continuous deep flux. Relative rhetorical stabilities must emerge to permit the construction of political strategies, and thus, at any given time, 'the terrain of dominant discourse is the only plausible arena of struggle' (Scott, 1990: 102). Second, imagining, formulating, and disseminating a brand-new commonplace requires an unusual level of commitment on the part of a claimant in terms of material resources, time, and effort. Deploying existing commonplaces -which have already been imagined, formulated, and disseminated -is far less costly (McAdam et al., 2001: 47-50). The process of transforming an unusual rhetorical form into a commonplace is necessarily lengthy and uncertain, but political actors normally possess far shorter time horizons. Arguments can prove powerful only when the commonplaces on which they draw are already present in the rhetorical field, which is shaped both by the unintended consequences of prior episodes of contestation and/or by campaigns undertaken in advance with the express purpose of reconfiguring the rhetorical terrain. Third, and related, novel rhetorical resources are likely to be drowned out by existing arguments and frames. Dense networks of communication carry and regularly reinforce established commonplaces, overwhelming proffered alternatives. Rhetorical innovations consequently tend to arise at the margins, where communication networks are less dense. Overcoming such barriers is possible in principle, but it is in reality so improbable that C and O must, in a given contentious episode, play within the rhetorical arena that presents itself to them. And that arena privileges particular frames and places others beyond the pale, regardless of the material resources at the speaker's disposal. If C and O were the only two actors in our stylized story, they might introduce novel arguments costlessly and endlessly, and rhetorical coercion would then be impossible. Their rhetorical maneuvers are constrained, however, because rhetorical contestation is public in nature (Bennett, 1980: 805-6). The continual competition for public legitimation ensures that P occupies a critical position, setting limits to the policy stances that the contestants can in practice advance. The relevant audience sets the contours of rhetorical contestation, and stepping beyond or reshaping them requires an investment not attractive or even feasible in the short run. This focus on the public's role constitutes a point of intersection with scholars in the rational-choice tradition who have ascribed great importance to 'audience costs' (Fearon, 1994). In such models, the actors and the audience have clear and consistent preferences that precede the contentious episode; public pronouncements serve to signal the content and/or intensity of those preferences. By contrast, our model does not begin by identifying and ordering the parties' desires, and the outcome of a particular episode does not depend on these preferences' content or ranking. Instead, the importance of the public P lies in the imperative for appeal frames to draw on rhetorical commonplaces present in the public's everyday deliberations (Shotter, 1993: 65-9; see also Bennett, 1980). Our model presumes not that European Journal of International Relations 13(1) P has a well-thought-out position in advance on the issue being contested, but rather that there is only a limited set of arguments that P would, in principle, find minimally acceptable. 15  In sum, one argument 'wins' not because its grounds are 'valid' in the sense of satisfying the demands of universal reason or because it accords with the audience's prior normative commitments or material interests, but because its grounds are socially sustainable -because the audience deems certain rhetorical deployments acceptable and others impermissible. One cannot, however, fashion strict covering laws regarding the audience's response. Students of conversation and argumentation from across several disciplines (anthropology, communication, sociology, philosophy, psychology) have argued that context is unusually crucial to their field of study (Billig, 1996;Gumperz, 1982;Perelman, 1982;Sawyer, 2001;Shotter, 1993;Toulmin, 1958). Classifying structures of discourse, reconstructing the rhetorical possibilities, exploring the rhetorical interplay: these critical challenges require one to formulate arguments limited in time and space and limited by the arena of rhetorical competition. Thus, for example, we do not ask below what sorts of appeals are most effective in general at compelling authorities to grant oppressed minorities first-class citizenship. Rather, through an interrogation of the Israeli case, we suggest that a specific claim (framed around military sacrifice and the equation of rights and obligations) is more likely to be successful in a particular discursive context (when talk about citizenship is narrowly republican). Such an explanation is modest, yet powerful, and potentially generalizable.",
          "The logic of rhetorical coercion suggests that two factors are most important in explaining when the model will have explanatory value. First, is P a relevant party to C's claims-making? Recall that C's power is rooted in its credible threat, implicit or explicit, to bring P in on its side; C's ability to do so deprives O of the option of refusing to respond to or even acknowledge C's claims. If C cannot issue its threat credibly, then O can safely ignore C's claims, no matter how they are framed. We can readily imagine conditions under which P would not be relevant to the interaction between the protagonists in our stylized story. It may be that P simply cannot hear C -perhaps because C is being actively repressed; perhaps because C lacks sufficient resources to publicize its message; or perhaps because C's claims regard alleged misdeeds that transpire far from the public eye. 16 Moreover, in some social contexts, decisions need not be justified. 17 The prevalence of justificatory behavior in the political arena suggests, however, that we are correct to maintain that the scope of the model's application is quite large.",
          "Second, how limited is the universe of rhetorical commonplaces? We have argued that actors must, in any particular claims-making episode, forge their appeals by drawing upon existing commonplaces that represent the boundaries of legitimate framing. When these boundaries are loose, numerous rhetorical strands are available, ensuring that O can almost always put forward a meaningful rebuttal to C. In such circumstances, the terms of debate are hardly constraining. When these boundaries are relatively restricted, rhetorical coercion is more easily achieved, as O has less rhetorical 'wiggle room' -that is, fewer socially plausible ways of rebutting C's claim. We recognize that verbal appeals are multivocal, that advocates and opponents of particular policies may advance their arguments employing similar terms. But public language, in our view, is never infinitely flexible, and even so capacious a rhetorical formulation as that of 'rights' in the American context disciplines the speaker. Such disciplining is more common and thus rhetorical coercion is more likely when speakers have fewer commonplaces on which to draw. 18",
          "One of the most venerable norms in the West is that linking military service and citizenship. 'Whoever puts himself in the service of the state', observed Otto Hintze, 'must logically and fairly be granted the regular rights of citizenship' (Hintze, 1975: 211), and the call to the colors is widely considered the supreme example of state service (Janowitz, 1976). Thus the leaders of those relegated to second-class citizenship have often counseled in wartime against draft evasion and have even urged voluntary enlistment. Afterwards they have shrewdly contrasted their people's record of loyalty and sacrifice to the reality of entrenched political and social inequity. For instance, African-Americans volunteered in droves for the Union Army in the US Civil War and for the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, wrapping their postwar demands in the bloody flag. The rhetoric of military sacrifice has at times proven effective. Mobilized veterans have most obviously exploited their status to gain both political rights and distributional benefits. Oppressed and marginalized ethnic, racial, and religious groups have, based upon their collective sacrifice, also advanced claims for citizenship rights, albeit with varying degrees of success. African-Americans, for example, have repeatedly found this path to citizenship blocked. But their lack of postwar progress is hardly surprising given the high stakes of citizenship battles. The demands of subordinate groups for first-class citizenship challenge the core of the existing social order, and the opposition to meaningful change is consequently often fierce. It is not African-Americans' repeated failures that require explanation as much as the successes of others -such as American women after World War I, Japanese-Americans European Journal of International Relations 13(1) after World War II, and Sikhs in post-independence India -in deploying the rhetoric of sacrifice to win improvements in their status. The opponents of reform typically occupy powerful positions in political, social, and economic structures, and few would expect them to give way before words alone. The politics of citizenship is thus a 'hard case' for the power of rhetoric, for material interests and resources would appear to provide a ready explanation for which groups' citizenship claims are granted and which are denied. We will argue, however, that the particular rhetorical configurations advanced by Israel's various Arab minorities help explain these groups' differential rates of success in overcoming the barriers to first-class citizenship in this 'ethnic democracy' (Smooha, 1997). Drawing on their record of military service, Druze Arabs argued that equal obligations demand equal rights. Jewish politicians found themselves unable to craft a culturally meaningful rebuttal to Druze demands, and they were compelled to concede Druze claims. In contrast, Christian and Muslim Arabs, who have never been drafted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), insisted that Israel abide by its public commitment to liberal democracy. While this frame also drew on Israeli commonplaces, it permitted Jewish politicians to justify discrimination against Christians and Muslims by arguing that those who do not perform civic duties cannot lay claim to equivalent public rights and benefits. Although the Druze were poorer than their fellow Arabs and smaller in number, for many years they were more effective in placing their concerns on the national agenda and in garnering a favorable response from the authorities. Consequently, material factors cannot account for the success of the Druze relative to other Arabs, and Jewish politicians' continual resistance to Druze demands suggests that persuasion was not at work. Israel's relationship with its Arab minorities nicely illustrates the power and limits of rhetorical coercion. 19   Background Israel's Arab population -today well over a million strongis divided by religion, with the Muslims, the Christians, and the Druze constituting the three largest groups. Possessing basic political rights, the entire Arab community has enjoyed great socioeconomic progress since Israel's founding in 1948, particularly relative to Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and to Arabs throughout the Middle East. Yet they have also been openly labeled a fifth column, and they have, often without regard to religious affiliation, been the victims of variegated forms of discrimination on the part of the state and the majority Jewish population. The new Israeli government subjected Arabs to military rule, conducted pervasive surveillance within the Arab communities, limited Arabs' capacity for travel and an independent economy, expropriated the bulk of Arab-controlled land, excluded Arabs from the giant labor Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms federation known as the Histadrut, and so on. Jewish leaders typically invoked the language of security to justify these policies, but its broad definition encompassed ideological, economic, and even partisan interests as well as security more narrowly conceived. Much overt discrimination came to an end by the late 1960s, but substantial discrimination persisted in more subtle forms (Kretzmer, 1988;Lustick, 1980;Shafir and Peled, 2002). Starting from this common baseline, however, the paths of Israel's Arab minorities have diverged. While all continue today to endure second-class status relative to Jewish Israelis, the Druze have made greater headway than the larger and wealthier Christian and Muslim communities. Since 1956 the Druze have been able to deploy a set of rhetorical commonplaces unavailable to their Christian and Muslim neighbors. That year, male Druze became subject to the military draft, reversing a policy of exemption that had been applied to all Arabs since the passage of Israel's universal conscription law in 1950 (Peled, 1998). Some have speculated plausibly that the Israeli authorities hoped that Druze service in the IDF would provide proof of Israeli liberalism and thereby neutralize Arab nationalists and satisfy Western critics (Firro, 1999;Lustick, 1980), but even full declassification of the relevant documents would not definitively establish the government's motives. We argue that, regardless of who wanted to draft the Druze and why, conscription helped the Druze prosper in Israeli politics.",
          "In the mid-1960s, the Druze began to mobilize, and they regularly sought a public forum in which to air their grievances, which they consistently framed around their people's military service and the equation of rights and obligations. In 1967 Druze activists circulated widely an appeal insisting that 'since we have done our duties … and see in the lack of equality … an infringement and denial of our rights, we urgently demand correction of this wrong' (Firro, 1999: 187). Surveying the history of Druze claims-making, one scholar noted that, among both Jews and the Druze, 'injustices to individual Druzes are usually attacked as ingratitude toward a man who was willing to shed his blood for his country, but now his country turns against him' (Ben Dor, 1979: 134-5). Even in recent years, the Druze have continued to gravitate to this rhetorical mode. During a series of public protests in the 1990s, mayors of Druze villages and towns 'usually denounce [ed] the Israeli government for its broken promises, and stress[ed] the price paid by the community in the form of hundreds of Druze soldiers killed during their service in the Israeli army' (Yiftachel and Segal, 1998: 487). Even the minority of Druze who have objected to the draft have accepted these basic terms. As a Communist Druze Knesset representative argued in the early 1990s, 'If this is a blood covenant, then give us the feeling that we are living in our state, in our homeland, with full rights like all citizens . . . And if there is to be no equality European Journal of International Relations 13(1) of rights, then do not demand equality of obligations, and allow Druze to choose -to serve or not to serve in the IDF' (Zohar, 1991). In constructing their claims frame, the Druze have drawn on rhetorical commonplaces deeply rooted in Israel's rhetorical traditions. Although participation in the pre-state Jewish community, the yishuv, was necessarily voluntary, it prized individual and group commitment to the public good, defined as the historical mission of the Jewish people to rebuild the land of Israel and epitomized by the kibbutz movement. The new state preserved this emphasis on civic commitment as the basis for membership, grafting a powerful statist ideology onto the earlier discourse (Liebman and Don Yihya, 1983). In an early Knesset debate, Prime Minister David Ben Gurion insisted that women too be subject to the draft, bluntly declaring, 'There are no rights without obligations. And above all is the obligation of security, the obligation of defending our existence, our freedom, our independence, and our growth' (Divre Ha-Knesset, 1950: 3:537). Even dissidents have protested within the terms of this dominant definition of citizenship: as one conscientious objector from the Lebanon War put it, 'military service, paying taxes, and obeying the law . . . That is what makes you a citizen and makes you eligible to enjoy the defense and the fruits that [the state] equally distributes' (Helman, 2000: 324). 20  This civic republican tradition has long sat uncomfortably alongside an ascriptive component in the definition of the Israeli polity. The 1948 Declaration of Independence proclaimed the new country 'the Jewish state' even as it promised that Israel would promote the welfare and protect the basic freedoms of all its inhabitants. The country's formal name, the State of Israel, suggests an abiding commitment to pluralistic secularism, but its historical-religious title, the Land of Israel, remains in popular use (Kimmerling, 1985). Some have concluded that 'Jewish ethnicity is a necessary condition for membership in the political community, while the contribution to the process of Jewish national redemption is a measure of one's civic virtue' (Peled, 1992: 435). Yet this ignores the potential contradictions between these discourses. Such tensions are muted when only Jewish citizens are drafted, for then Israeli leaders can publicly embrace civic republicanism while preserving ethnoreligious priorities. But Druze claims-making framed around collective military sacrifice challenged the coherence of Israel's 'ethnorepublican' citizenship. Confronted with such a challenge, Jewish Israeli leaders had two alternatives: either they could acknowledge their exclusive definition of the political community, or they could open its doors. While the Druze squeezed concessions out of Jewish politicians beginning in the late 1960s, there is no evidence that their appeals were persuasive: both the limited and incremental nature of Israeli concessions as well as the grudging fashion in which they were offered are not consistent with a narrative centered Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms around persuasion. Rather, our model of rhetorical coercion can help explain why the Druze made headway in this ethnic democracy. Faced with Druze claims, Jewish leaders could have launched a framing contest by (a) admitting openly the discriminatory nature of the state. Alternatively, they could have conceded the Druze frame but challenged its implications by (b) claiming that the Druze were not relatively disadvantaged or (c) arguing that the Druze community's problems were of its own making. The first alternative frame was unappealing -not just because of the likely international repercussions, but also because it would have contradicted both Israel's self-proclaimed status as the sole democracy in the Middle East and its dominant way of speaking about citizenship. The second put forward a claim widely known to be false, and the third possible response, while perhaps plausible with regard to questions of economic development, could not justify administrative segregation, which was, whether cleverly or fortunately, among Druze activists' first targets. There was, however, a fourth option: Jewish politicians could have refused to reply -as long as relevant audiences were unaware of the Druze's plight. The Druze's capacity to engage in rhetorical coercion was consequently dependent on garnering attention from the Hebrew-language media. As a general rule, the Hebrew press rarely covered the Arab communities, for its readership was almost entirely Jewish. But the Druze arguments were resonant with republican rhetorical practice, producing a narrative that Jewish publics comprehended and embraced. As a result, when the Druze made noise, the press amplified it, compensating for the Druze's lack of political clout and ensuring a hearing in the halls of power (Asa'ad, 2000;Toledano, 2000). In short, the Druze trapped Jewish leaders in a rhetorical cul-de-sac in which an implication or framing contest was unsustainable. They maneuvered their Jewish opponents onto a rhetorical playing field on which the Druze could not lose, for no rebuttal would have been acceptable to key audiences, both domestic and international. Wary of calling punishment upon themselves, Jewish leaders had little choice but to concede. Consequently, 'when the Druze demanded something, the ears were much more open' (Toledano, 2000). Despite the Druze community's electoral insignificance, cases of alleged discrimination against individual Druze received attention even in the Knesset (Ben Dor, 1979: 134-6). The Druze demand in the late 1960s for full membership in the Labor Party was irrefutable: as a prominent Labor functionary wrote in a major newspaper, 'How can we explain to that Druze … that he is good enough to endanger his life for the state but that he is not good enough to be a member of the Labor Party?' (Lin, 1970). Confident that their rhetorical resources have bequeathed disproportionate influence, the Druze have resisted an alliance with their numerous fellow Arabs, with whom they share many grievances. Even those Druze otherwise critical of Israel's policies have often supported continued conscription so that European Journal of International Relations 13(1) the military sacrifice frame would remain available. Lacking abundant political resources, the Druze adopted a strategy aimed at rhetorical coercion, and they demonstrated that it could work. Jewish politicians were compelled to say things they (likely) did not believe and ultimately even to follow through on those promises. Like their Druze counterparts, Christian and Muslim Arabs drew on Israeli commonplaces, arguing that Israel needed to eliminate discriminatory measures to live up to its democratic promise. Yet, in comparison to the Druze, they have encountered far greater public resistance, for Jewish politicians had a rhetorical escape hatch. Arab rights, they often argued, were not sacrosanct, for those who did not fulfill their civic obligations (that is, military service) deserved less protection than those who had made the supreme sacrifice. In seeking to convince a wavering Knesset member to support the military administration in 1962, Ben Gurion protested, 'I have recognized all these years that rights are dependent on obligations . . . I do not understand why I may limit the freedom and steal the time of young Jewish men and women when they are in the army, but why it is forbidden to limit much less the freedom of those who do not serve in the army.' 21 That same Labor functionary who advocated offering the Druze membership in the party justified the exclusion of other Arabs on similar grounds: 'I asked them [close Arab friends] how they could sit in the party central committee … next to a bereaved father or mother, next to a party member who had just returned from the front, next to a member who stands ready to leave the next day for reserve service, while they still do not fulfill this obligation' (Lin, 1970). Faced with claims framed in liberal terms, Jewish leaders had a response at the ready, evading the rhetorical dead-end into which Christians and Muslims might have hoped to maneuver them. For decades, this rhetorical move has frustrated Arab efforts to attain first-class citizenship. As one Arab activist recently complained, 'They are trying to link our rights as citizens to performing military service. That's not how a real democracy works' (quoted in Schechter, 2003). Christian and Muslim claimants have long remained mired in a framing contest, unable to persuade or rhetorically coerce Jewish politicians. 22   Alternative Explanations How else might one explain the relative success of the Druze in attaining increments of Israeli effective citizenship? The most intuitive answer would attribute this outcome to the distribution of material resources. But the Druze's potential voter base has been tiny, their per capita income has remained relatively low, they have historically eschewed violent confrontation with the authorities, and they have often had difficulty creating and sustaining effective lobbying organizations (Firro, 1999). By all standard measures of political power, the Druze should have been less successful than other Arabs, not more so.",
          "A second alternative would invert the first. Precisely because the Druze were so small, so weak, and so moderate, Israel could countenance their inclusion in the IDF and grant them some modicum of effective citizenship without threatening the state's Jewish identity. Had the Druze's population been as large as Israel's Christian or Muslim communities, concessions would have been unthinkable. The Druze's small size made them an attractive target for cooptation (Lustick, 1980). But if this argument were correct, presumably the state should have flung its doors wide open, for the costs would have been negligible and the propaganda advantages substantial. In fact, however, while Jewish decision-makers readily offered rhetorical concessions to the Druze, they resisted implementation: 'To say that if the ears were open, things were done -there is a difference' (Toledano, 2000). The Druze made tangible progress, but they fought hard for those increments of meaningful citizenship. Nor did the Druze act like a model coopted minority. They were not content with petty favors, but rather became deeply dissatisfied with their status and continually presented Jewish leaders with difficult and uncomfortable choices. A third alternative would posit that Israel's conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 and the addition of a large, politicized Palestinian population gave Jewish politicians incentives to grant Druze citizens' demands so as to prevent the Palestinization of the Druze community. Presumably, however, they faced far greater incentives to accommodate the much larger Christian and Muslim citizen populations, whose members had not yet openly allied with the Palestinian national cause. Nevertheless, the Israeli establishment remained highly resistant to Christian and Muslim claims-making. This argument thus has difficulty accounting for the divergent patterns in Israel's relations with its various Arab communities after 1967 -a difficulty not faced by the mechanism of rhetorical coercion. A fourth alternative account would attribute the Druze anomaly to their predilection for taqiyya, or the art of concealment. 23 Long viewed as heretics by their Muslim neighbors, the Druze have historically sought to shield themselves from persecution by hiding their religious observances. With regard to politics, this ultra-pragmatic doctrine prescribes neutrality when possible and 'bandwagoning' -allying with the likely victor -when necessary (Layish, 1985). One would thus have expected the Druze to avoid challenging stronger parties, but in fact the Druze displayed a rebellious streak during Ottoman and European colonial domination of the region. Despite a long history of communal tension, they made common cause with their fellow Arabs in the struggle for Lebanese autonomy early in the 20th century. And, frustrated that one foreign ruler had simply replaced another, their leadership initiated a nationalist revolt against the French in the mid-1920s -with disastrous consequences (Tauber, 1993a(Tauber, , 1993b;;Firro, 1999). The Druze were not proto-nationalists, but they were at times willing to set aside intra-Arab differences, compelling one to ask why they European Journal of International Relations 13(1) did not cast their lot with other Arabs in Israel in the decades after 1948. Taqiyya is obviously of little help in answering this question. Equally important, it lacks analytical bite. The doctrine is so flexible that it is less an explanation for Druze behavior than a tidy description of it.",
          "The Druze's success in compelling Jewish Israeli politicians to grant them a modicum of first-class citizenship illustrates nicely the operation of rhetorical coercion. Although this single case study cannot of course prove that the mechanism is generalizable, we view rhetorical coercion as among the set of 'widely operating explanatory mechanisms that combine differently and therefore produce different outcomes in one setting or another ' (McAdam et al., 2001: 13-14). The Druze case suggests the applicability of rhetorical coercion to domestic politics, but is the mechanism operative in the international arena? Extending the earlier theoretical discussion leads to the conclusion that rhetorical coercion is more likely as social ties in political communities, domestic and even international, grow increasingly extensive and dense. On the whole, however, rhetorical coercion will operate less effectively and less frequently in international settings. Key factors highlighted by the model are often present in international relations: state leaders speak to international audiences, they are sensitive to those audiences' reactions, and justificatory speech acts are prevalent. Indeed, while not systematically elaborating the mechanism's dynamics, others have shown rhetorical coercion to be of critical explanatory importance in such divergent contexts as Cold War crisis bargaining (Bially Mattern, 2004), intra-Arab alliance dynamics (Barnett, 1998), eastward enlargement of the European Union and NATO (Fierke and Wiener, 1999;Schimmelfenig, 2004), and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev's proposals for nuclear disarmament (Evangelista, 2001). Yet even these examples suggest the limits of rhetorical coercion in international politics. Rhetorical coercion, like other forms of political communication, is premised on a political community that shares at least some understandings of the boundaries of acceptable discourse. The more tightly linked the community, the greater the possibilities for rhetorical coercion. Thus it is not surprising to find this mechanism primarily operative among regional groupings with relatively strong requirements for legitimation. The Soviet Union had long legitimated its leadership of the communist bloc by casting itself as the true force for global peace, and its routine calls for nuclear disarmament sustained that claim; Soviet generals could not publicly dispute Gorbachev's proposal without simultaneously undercutting Soviet authority among communist regimes. Similarly, Egypt had, under Nasser, positioned itself as the leader of the Arab world Krebs and Jackson: Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms based on a pan-Arab discourse that represented Israel as its inherently opposed Other; Nasser reluctantly accepted the risk of war with Israel in 1967 because deviating from the norms of Arab nationalist discourse would have imperiled Egypt's status as the spokesman for Arab nationalism and might have jeopardized his regime's stability. Finally, the European Union, the most tightly bound regional arrangement on the globe today, could not have denied membership to consolidated democracies in Eastern Europe without contradicting the community's legitimating discourse which had intertwined the European concept with liberal democracy; to have vetoed or even vocally opposed eastward enlargement would have challenged the basis for community and threatened individual members' credibility. Such dynamics thus depend on the strength and density of the ties binding the community's members, and such ties vary substantially across the international system. 24 Where such ties are strong and dense -that is, within such regional groupings of states, where international anarchy (as even realists might concede) is most attenuated -rhetorical coercion remains distinctly possible. The cosmopolitan dream of a 'global public' remains today just that, although there are emerging global standards of legitimacy in several arenas and increasingly robust mechanisms through which norm violators might be held accountable (Grant and Keohane, 2005). Where such ties are weak and sparse -as in relations across such regional groupings and as in the many arenas lacking shared bases for legitimation -rhetorical coercion will be far more difficult. As the metaphor of the two-level game implies, political elites in such circumstances are likely to be engaged with and responsive to multiple and different audiences simultaneously, and these audiences are unlikely to share a single conception of what rhetorical moves are acceptable and appropriate. The more complex the social environment, the greater the opportunities for actors to evade the consequences of rhetorical interchange, and thus the more imposing the obstacles to rhetorical coercion. Where such ties have never existed or have been ruptured -perhaps as a consequence of the limits of communications technologies or perhaps as a result of enduring interstate rivalry -communication (including rhetorical coercion) is impossible, and diplomacy is a dialogue of the deaf. As a consequence, it is not the imposing capacity of foreign publics, let alone some elusive global public, to sanction state action that makes rhetorical coercion potentially successful on the international scene. When rhetorical coercion is operative internationally, the critical punishing agent is more often a domestic audience prepared to exact costs for violations of standards of rhetorical appropriateness. While foreigners have disapproved of American unilateralism in recent years, it is not clear that this opposition has driven their governments' policies (Brooks and Wohlforth, 2005), and while anti-Americanism has unquestionably been prevalent, its political consequences European Journal of International Relations 13(1) appear to have often been exaggerated (Keohane and Katzenstein, 2006). The George W. Bush administration could dismiss foreign opposition to the Iraq War, particularly because cooperation on matters of joint concern such as trade and terrorism (narrowly construed) continued seemingly unabated. But the American public's increasing disenchantment with the war has been a far greater cause for concern for the administration, as it is this public that might be directly brought into a political contest over the war -a political contest within which rhetorical coercion is far more likely to operate. 25",
          "Machiavelli famously advised that 'a ruler need not have all the positive qualities …but he must seem to have them… He must seem, to those who listen to him and watch him, entirely pious, truthful, reliable, sympathetic, and religious' (Machiavelli, 1994: 55). Realists, not inaccurately, read Machiavelli as warning against allowing moral considerations to impede actions necessary for the pursuit of political power. But, as coercive constructivists, we would add that these lines imply that social identity has an effect on social and political outcomes, regardless of whether or not the actor internalizes the components constituting this identity. A ruler pursuing policies incapable of public justification would find her path strewn with numerous practical obstacles. This lack of rhetorical resources might even compel her to alter her course of action. In accord with other constructivists, we aver that social norms and social identities matter. 26 In accord with political realists, we argue that whether or not a social actor has internalized a particular set of normative principles is not causally relevant. In accord with the broader cultural turn in the social sciences, we combine these positions by focusing on public language, on how normative principles are deployed in public debate, and by exploring the causal impact this deployment can have on what people say and consequently on what they do -not on the impossibly elusive question of what they believe. Our model of rhetorical coercion can helpfully capture the dynamics of framing contests, when there is controversy about how an issue should be characterized, and of implication contests, when narrower (yet no less important) battles are waged over the consequences of some accepted framing. Our analysis draws attention to two key conditions affecting the applicability of the model. First, rhetorical coercion can occur only when the public is a party to the debate or when the claimant can credibly threaten to involve the audience. Second, not all structures of discourse are equally conducive to rhetorical coercion. This mechanism is more likely to operate when these structures are relatively restricted (and constraining) than when they are relatively loose (and permissive). Furthermore, our model cannot illuminate the process of rhetorical contest in two circumstances: first, when an opponent accepts a claim without argument, and, second, when an opponent accepts the implications of an argument but not its terms. We contend, however, that much social and political life lies within our model's scope. 27  In short, this article seeks to invigorate the study of political rhetoricbut in a fashion relatively unfamiliar to recent debates in international and comparative politics. We argue that rhetorical contestation shapes policy outcomes and that the approaches most common in these subfields miss a significant portion of political and social reality. We further suggest that it is possible to make causal claims without trespassing into the murky waters of subjective motivation and without relying on problematic mechanisms like persuasion. Many IR constructivists would be comfortable with the first of these claims, many realists and students of political culture with the second, few from either camp with their combination. This article has sought to demonstrate that their conjunction is both logically sustainable and potentially productive.",
          "material interests' problematic and have instead embraced a linguistic focus that is not dissimilar to our own. 5. Among those drawing on social psychology are Checkel (2001); Crawford (2002: 26-7);and Johnston (2001). Others have remained agnostic as to how persuasion operates (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998). We limit ourselves here to discussion of the Habermasian version of the persuasion argument, since in our judgment it is the most clearly articulated mechanism. For an alternative treatment of Habermas in international relations, see Mitzen (2005). 6. On the lack of evidence of changed minds in Crawford (2002), see Dessler and Owen (2005: 602). 7. We are grateful to Kathryn Sikkink for helpful discussion on this point. 8. For treatments closer to our own, see, among others, Barnett (1998); Bially Mattern (2004); Fierke (1998); Goddard (2006). 9. Such language even slips on occasion into our own case study, for the conventions of historical writing insist on subjects who possess agency, articulate goals, and pursue motives. The Foucauldian alternative -interrogating the central discursive formations -might help us escape this trap, but it would come at the cost of the narrative form, which better captures the tensions and surprising reversals of actual political contest. Such traces of motivational language are consequently inevitable, but they should not cloud or draw attention from the rhetorical dynamics themselves. We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pressing us on this point. 10. The distinction between persuasion and coercion as modes of political influence is by no means original, but our conceptualization of rhetorical contestation as potentially coercive is more unusual. Scholars, especially those working within a psychological framework, sometimes treat persuasion as synonymous with all attitude change, citing even nuclear deterrence as an example. In contrast, we define coercion as the imposition of constraint on choice, whereas normative persuasion seeks ideally to bypass choice. Both coercion and persuasion may lead the target to assent, but the coerced target merely complies, while the persuaded target consents. Put differently, persuasion speaks to change in preferences, while coercion seeks to alter the social environment confronting an actor while leaving preferences untouched. 11. For a related discussion of 'realist constructivism', see Jackson and Nexon (2004). 12. Note that 'acceptance' here does not imply agreement, but refers only to O's public reaction to C's argument. 13. While we make no strong assumptions regarding the content of the actors' motives, the model does rely on the thin, almost trivial, assumption that actors are fundamentally strategic -that they pursue policies that they believe will further their goals (McAdam et al., 2001). 14. For related arguments, see Cruz (2000); Spillman (1995); Steinberg (1999). 15. In this stylized model, we presume that both actors must legitimate their stance in the eyes of the same audience, but the reality of both international and domestic politics is often more complicated. Speakers in both arenas may be playing to entirely different audiences or may be competing to define which audience is in fact relevant. The dynamics of such contestation are not well addressed by this paper and will be taken up in future articles. We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for raising this question. 16. This is not infrequently the case when O is a government whose commands are implemented by a secretive bureaucracy. A potential weakness of rhetorical coercion is its implication that rhetorical concessions translate smoothly into policy change. O may renege on its commitments, particularly during implementation when there may be little need for public justification. While such breakdowns are likely, we maintain that violations will prove difficult to sustain should C hold O's feet to the public fire in a new episode of rhetorical contestation. 17. Superiors often do not explain their logic to subordinates, and exasperated parents often tell children, 'Just do as I say!' In such circumstances, rhetorical contestation is not likely to be effective. We are grateful to Robert Jervis for pointing this out. 18. For more on the logic of rhetorical coercion, see Jackson (2006); Krebs (2006). 19. For a more extensive treatment of these cases, see Krebs (2006: Chs 3-5). 20. Military service occupies so prominent a site in the Israeli cultural complex that 'civic virtue has been constructed in terms of and identified with military virtue' (Helman, 2000: 320). 21. Ben Gurion to M.K. Yizhar, 12 February 1962, State Archives (Jerusalem, Israel), Office of the Prime Minister Files, C 6304/1086. 22. Christians and Muslims could not control the rhetorical playing field, but they nevertheless made significant gains in the mid-1980s thanks to their raw political power. After the 1977 breakdown of Labor Zionism's stranglehold over the political system, the electoral competition tightened, and the Arab population was actively wooed. Candidates from across the political spectrum stumped for the first time in Arab villages, and the major parties committed themselves to improving the Arabs' lot. 23. A different version of the cultural argument, which Druze and Jews alike have relished, argues that the two peoples are natural allies as fellow minorities in the Muslim Middle East. But the assertion of a natural Jewish-Druze affinity is propagandistic rhetoric that has, since the founding of Israel, served the interests of both Israeli officials and Druze leaders. Druze religious texts are typically dismissive of other religions, and while particularly disparaging of Islam -the dominant regional religious tradition responsible for their oppression -they are hardly admiring of Jews. See Parsons (2001: 70-6); and Dana (2003: 43-51). 24. As this formulation suggests, we believe that network analysis provides a more useful set of tools for grasping such variation than do metaphors regarding, for example, the 'thickness' of the 'normative environment' (Barnett, 1998: 39). For an insightful application of network logic to imperial dynamics, see Nexon and Wright (forthcoming). 25. Consider also the examples discussed earlier. That audiences in the communist bloc outside the USSR might have questioned Soviet leadership or that Arab elites might have challenged Egypt's did matter, but primarily indirectly. Had the Soviet generals or Nasser anticipated that domestic audiences would respond to the prospective loss of regional or ideological authority with collective indifference, they would have perceived themselves to be operating with a far freer hand. That domestic audiences were sensitive to their country's standing in the relevant community of nations, and were believed to be prepared to act on that basis, was crucial in these cases. 26. The language of identity has not figured explicitly in this article, but it is our view that rhetoric and identity are inseparable. Identity is not the mental property of an individual, nor can collective identity be apprehended by aggregating the attitudes of the constituent individuals. Rather, identities are necessarily relational, and thus they are forged through the process of their articulation. Political communities are defined by a common rhetorical lexicon and coalesce around particular rhetorical configurations. 27. Our model cannot, however, capture the long-term processes through which new commonplaces enter the rhetorical space."

          "Humanity and societies today face challenges to sustainability, which fundamentally relates to the ability to sustain humanity, civilizations and ecosystems on Earth. These challenges are expected to become more significant in the future. Achieving sustainability is therefore one of the most important objectives of a society and its people. The issues and concerns embodied by sustainability are broad and numerous. They cover such diverse issues as resource supply (water, energy, mineral, food), climate change and pollution, management of wastes (toxic, hazardous, radioactive, convention- ISSN 2283-7949 GLOCALISM: JOURNAL OF CULTURE, POLITICS AND INNOVATION 2018, 3, DOI: 10.12893/gjcpi.2018.3.4 Published online by \"Globus et Locus\" at www.glocalismjournal.net  al), sanitation, land use and desertification, species extinction and loss of biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, water quality and drought, industrial development, production and consumption patterns, population growth, urbanization, globalization, cultural and social sustainability, natural and anthropogenic disasters, peace and stability and government policies. The breadth of topics related to sustainability suggests that a holistic and comprehensive approach to sustainability is necessary. Sustainability activities are increasingly becoming part of the agendas and operating plans of governments and businesses. The elements of sustainability need to be connected if activities are to attain sustainability goals. In the remainder of this chapter, the historical context for sustainability is briefly described, sustainability concepts and definitions are reviewed, and sustainability is discussed, focusing on its economic, environmental and social dimensions as well as issues and concerns. The related concept of sustainable development is examined. Then, assessment measures for sustainability are considered, and some sustainability applications are presented.",
          "The challenge of achieving sustainability for societies is not limited to the present day, even though the global nature of the problem has come to the fore in recent decades. Sustainability was an objective, at least implicitly, for early civilizations. Since humans transitioned from mobile hunter-gatherers to agriculture and settlements approximately 12,000 years ago during the Neolithic age, in what has come to be known as the agricultural revolution, the sustainability of the lifestyle was crucial in determining if society would thrive or collapse. The decline of the Western Roman Empire constitutes another noteworthy historical illustration of a society that failed to sustain itself and ultimately collapsed. Waning returns from natural resource production as well as social factors contributed to the decline (Tainter 1998). The multidimensional nature of sustainability became more evident in more recent history, especially with concerns over environmental degradation. ISSN 2283-7949 GLOCALISM: JOURNAL OF CULTURE, POLITICS AND INNOVATION 2018, 3, DOI: 10.12893/gjcpi.2018.3.4 Published online by \"Globus et Locus\" at www.glocalismjournal.net  The case of the Polynesians on Easter Island, located in the Pacific Ocean, provides an important historical illustration of how unsustainable practices and lifestyles can contribute or lead to societal collapse. The inhabitants of Easter Island exhausted the resources of their remote habitat to such an extent that they could no longer feed themselves or even build canoes to escape. The ecological damage to Easter Island led to a total societal collapse that decimated its population compared to its peak in the 1600s (Graedel, Allenby 2010).",
          "Numerous definitions of sustainability exist, but none apply for all circumstances. Making sustainability operational rather than vague and theoretical is a challenge, which is made all the more daunting due to the numerous definitions of sustainability. In theory, sustainability can be defined as \"enduring in perpetuity\". However, such a definition is neither practical nor useful. Little if anything can be sustained forever, while much can be sustained over the very short term. A timescale of 50 to 100 years, representing two to four generations, is often viewed as more practical. A simple definition sustainability was stated by Ehrenfeld, who defined sustainability as \"the possibility that human and other forms of life will flourish on the planet forever\". Although this definition incorporates environmental and societal aspects, the timescale is impractical. Taking a more technical perspective, sustainability can be defined in terms of carrying capacity, which indicates the maximum number of people that can be supported in a given area, accounting for availability of resources and the ability of the environment to accept waste emissions. The carrying capacity for a region is in particular dependent on the demand and supply of natural resources. But sustainability encompasses more than technical factors and cannot be defined from an environmental perspective exclusively. Rather, sustainability is often conceptually defined as having three dimensions: environmental, economic and social. An important feature of this approach is the extension of sustainability beyond carrying capacity to include economic and social fac- tors. A multidimensional view of sustainability is consistent with the understanding of how several factors affect whether societies thrive or decline. But these three dimensions are often in tension (e.g., environmental and social sustainability may be achieved to the detriment of economic sustainability). Achieving a sustainable balance is challenging. Sustainability, and its three main dimensions, can be conceptually illustrated in various ways: a) Sustainability can be viewed as founded or supported by three legs or pillars, representing environmental, economic and social sustainability (fig. 1). This is akin to a three-leg table that can only remain standing if environmental, economic and social sustainability dimensions are satisfied. This balance can prove challenging, since the sustainability dimensions are often in conflict; b) Sustainability can also can be thought of as the common point of overlap of three intersecting circles, where the three circles represent the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability (fig. 2); c) A variation on this representation displays sustainability using concentric circles (fig. 3). Economic sustainability, being an activity of people and occurring within communities, is seen to be a subset of social sustainability, which involves many social and cultural dimensions as well as economic factors. Then social sustainability is seen to be a subset of environmental sustainability, since activities of people and societies are carried out within the environment and thus threaten environmental sustainability; d) The three dimensions of sustainability can be also shown in a hierarchal structure, where the economy is a subsystem of society, and society is embedded in the environment (fig. 4). These illustrations are similar, but have subtle differences. All of the illustrations demonstrate the interconnected nature of the environment, the economy and society, and their relations to and effects on sustainability for any a system or process. The above points also demonstrate the truly multidisciplinary nature of sustainability, and its linkages to diverse fields such as science, engineering, environment, ecology, economics, business, sociology and philosophy. Addressing sustainability requires consideration of topics such as resource use (energy and material), economic development, social development, health, environmental stewardship, engineering, design and architecture. It also requires an understanding of how people in the different disciplines interact and relate in addressing these factors.     Sustainability concepts can be focused around a discipline when needed or useful. For example, consider sustainability in engineering, which constitutes the application of science and mathematics principles for practical purposes such as the design, manufacturing and operation of products and processes, while accounting for economic, environmental, sociological and other constraints. Engineering significantly affects economic development, standards of living, societal well-being, the environment and cultural development. Numerous factors need to be addressed in moving towards engineering sustainability (fig. 5), including appropriate selection of resources bearing in mind sustainability criteria, use of sustainable engineering processes, enhancement of efficiency of engineering processes and resource use, and holistic adoption of environmental stewardship in engineering activities. In moving towards engineering sustainability, other key sustainability measures also need to be addressed, such as economics, equity, land use, lifestyle, sociopolitical factors and population. The multidimensional nature of sustainability suggests that achieving it is a systems challenge. That is because the overall in- teraction between subsystems needs to be integrated to achieve a sustainable system or process. For clarity, the three main dimensions of sustainability are each examined below.",
          "The economy and society are subsystems of the environment, which is the source and sink of all material and energy interactions on Earth. The sustainability of humanity implies ensuring an ability of the Earth to support human and activities related to it. Human economies and populations have grown such that anthropogenic activities now have global and long-term impacts, with various consequences. These can degrade the ability of the planet to support life. Many environmental issues affect sustainability. The loss of biodiversity throughout the world, due to economic development and other factors, and threatens the sustainability. Deforestation and development often lead to the destruction of natural habitats and cause the migration of animals to suitable environs. The extraction or use of limited resources and the release into the environment of emissions and wastes to the air, water and land also put sustainability at risk (Aghbashlo, Rosen 2018). Air pollutants released by internal combustion engines in vehicles, fossil fuel-fired electrical power plants and various industrial activities can adversely affect air quality and the health of humans and other living species. Industrial liquid emissions, including wastewater, and runoff from agricultural activity can lead to environmental problems, e.g., bioaccumulation of toxic compounds in the cells of aquatic animals, and eutrophication of water bodies. Two of the most significant challenges regarding environmental sustainability follow: Climate change. Stabilizing the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, in order to prevent the harmful effects of global warming and climate change, constitutes according to most studies one of today's most significant challenges. In the atmosphere, GHGs absorb infrared radiation emitted at the surface of the Earth. This leads to a greenhouse effect and the associated planetary warming. The primary GHG is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), but there are others such as methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The main anthropogenic sources of GHG emissions include fossil fuel combustion, agricultural nitrogen utilization, and enteric fermentation in ruminant animals. Global warming and the risks of climate destabilization are exacerbated by positive feedback effects, such as increased solar radiation absorption from the loss of reflecting surfaces like ice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has since 1990 published comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science and predictions about future trends. The fifth assessment report, finalized in 2014, reports warming trends due to anthropogenic activities as \"very likely\". As climate models become more sophisticated, the predicted amount of warming has increased, as have the related climate and other impacts. Much effort globally and at the United Nations is focused on achieving international agreements or treaties to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that avoids dangerous anthropogenic climate change (e.g. Berthiaume, Rosen 2017). Stratospheric ozone depletion. The layer of ozone (O 3 ) in the stratosphere reduces the transmission of solar radiation to the surface of the Earth. This stratospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, particularly UV-B, which can harm animals and plants. Declines in ozone levels in the stratosphere, especially over polar regions, were observed since the late 1970s. The main ozone depleting substances are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used for decades as refrigerants, which participate in ozone-destroying chemical reactions in the stratosphere. A phase out of CFCs was agreed to in 1989 via the Montreal Protocol, but they are still used in low-income countries. The long residence times of CFCs in the atmosphere implies that the reduced ozone layer concentrations will persist for many decades.",
          "An economy that provides good living standards, the services that people require and jobs is necessary for sustainability in society. A sustainable society requires long-term economic development rather than just economic growth. This latter, often meas- ured as growth in gross domestic product, is what occurs today, where capitalist economies depend on economic growth to generate wealth and jobs. Since the economy operates within a planet having finite resources and capacities (Aghbashlo, Rosen 2018), a continually growing economy is not necessarily sustainable over the long term. Eventually, therefore, the global economy needs to operate more in a steady-state manner, with little or zero growth. The best options for economic sustainability may vary from country to country. For instance, Daly (1990) suggests that wealthy countries need to develop instead of grow their economies in order to conserve resources and waste-assimilation capacities, and that poor countries benefit more from economic growth. Sometimes, economic sustainability arguments are divided into strong and weak sustainability categories: Strong sustainability. This view of sustainability is based on natural capital (the planet's stock of natural resources, including air, water, geology, soils and all living organisms) providing ecosystem services that are not substitutable with human capital (the stock of knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, creativity, and labor). Environmentalists and natural scientists often prefer this viewpoint of sustainability, seeing natural and human capital as complementary, but not interchangeable. Weak sustainability. This view of sustainability is based on the concept of a constant total capital stock, which is the sum of human and natural capital, and allows for human capital to substitute for natural capital. Economists often favor this view of sustainability, which permits natural resources to decline provided there is an increase in human capital, including know-how and knowledge. The difference between these two views of economic sustainability mainly focuses on the substitutability of human for natural capital. What constitutes societal sustainability may change temporally. For instance, people in the future may inhabit smaller houses, live in higher density neighborhoods, possess less material goods and travel less. Even if this leads to a lower gross domestic product per capita in the future, it may lead to a higher quality of life. Two major factors in societal sustainability follow: Equity. The concept of societal sustainability includes equity within and between generations. Intragenerational equity speaks to equity between people of the same generation, and requires more balanced distribution of wealth. This may necessitate shifts in resources between rich and poor nations and within them. Intergenerational equity focuses on equity between present and future generations, so as to ensure that future generations have are able to a attain a reasonably good quality of life compared to preceding generations. Intergenerational equity spanning two to four generations into the future, roughly equivalent to 50 to 100 years, is often envisioned as a necessary factor for societal sustainability. Health. Human health and well-being is an important factor social sustainability. Important measures of human health include life expectancy and infant mortality (Smil 2007). Many factors contribute to human health, including access to healthy and clean food and drinking water, safe waste disposal, and an environment without harmful substances that can lead to chronic or acute diseases (e.g. toxins and carcinogens). SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT To be developed: people (e.g., life expectancy, quality of life, education, equity), society (e.g., security, institutions) and the economy (e.g. wealth creation, jobs). Social and economic systems of people can be enhanced through development. For instance, the quality of life of people in developing countries can be improved through more equitable distribution of wealth, better education, and less reliance on non-renewable resources, leading to a more equitable society; b) To be developed: people (e.g., life expectancy, quality of life, education, equity), society (e.g., security, institutions) and the economy (e.g. wealth creation, jobs). Social and economic systems of people can be enhanced through development. For instance, the quality of life of people in developing countries can be improved through more equitable distribution of wealth, better education, and less reliance on non-renewable resources, leading to a more equitable society; c) To be sustained: life support systems (e.g. resources, land, soil, water, air), nature (e.g. ecosystems, habitats, biodiversity) and communities (e.g. cultures). Earth and its ecosystems provide ecosystem services (e.g. climate stability, water and air purification) and natural resources. These permit human communities to endure into the future and thrive. Thus, to sustain the services provided by nature that people have adapted to and depend upon, the Earth and its life-support systems need to be sustained. Ensuring that sustainable development is incorporated pervasively and comprehensively into industry, government, planners and people's lives is of great importance. Policies and strategies for sustainable development are needed that are sound, coordinated, meaningful realistic and achievable.  Tab 1.

Sustainability is a state that can be maintained into the future. But, since development means \"bringing gradually to an improved state\", sustainable development implies a course of action that improves the quality of life of people and societies, and that can endure into the future.",
          "The assessment of sustainability is important for making sustainability operational and measuring and monitoring progress towards sustainability. But assessing sustainability is challenging, since no universally accepted method exists for the task. There are many reasons for this, including the difficulty in measuring the main dimensions of sustainability (Hacatoglu et al. 2016). For example, although emissions of GHGs and ozone depleting substances are measurable, quantifying their economic and social impacts is challenging. Also, despite standard of living often being measured as gross domestic product per capita, quality of life can be a more significant measure of human well-being and satisfaction. Sustainability assessment can also be contentious (Morse, Fraser 2005). Nonetheless, various methods for assessing or measuring sustainability have been developed. Some examples: a) Some assessment methods utilize sustainability indicators, which are typically simple quantitative proxies that measure economic, social, and environmental factors. Some indicators are integrated, combining various dimensions of the environment, the economy and society, while others are not integrated, measuring only a single aspect of sustainability; b) Some sustainability indexes have been developed based on an aggregate or composite of selected sustainability indicators. A single-value measure of sustainability based on an aggregate index is beneficial for understanding and communication, due to its simplicity. But the determination of such indicators necessitates normalization, weighting and aggregation of data. These steps usually lead to a loss of useful information and can be challenging in their own right. A single-value sustainability measure can mask details associated with the multidimensional nature of sustainability and thus be misleading. Nonetheless, aggregate sustainability indexes are often preferred by policy makers in industry and government since they can be more easily interpreted and communicated to stakeholders or the public than multiple sustainability values; c) Daly (1990) developed operational principles for sustainable development. Although useful, these are limited to quasi-sustainable use of non-renewable resources and the use of renewable resources. Few if any sustainability assessment methods consider the environment, the economy and society together. Rather, many assessment methodologies focus on only one dimension of sustainability (e.g. economic development or environmental sustainability). Several examples are considered to illustrate this. First, biophysical assessment approaches are suited to assessing environmental sustainability, by quantifying resource use and environmental impact. But they are normally inadequate for addressing societal and economic facets of sustainability. Second, monetary values can be applied to social and environmental capital to assess sustainability. However, financial valuations for non-market goods and services are not well developed, improper valuations, and difficult due to our limited understanding of ecosystems and the services they provide. Third, the Environmental Sustainability Index ranks countries based on an aggregate of several environmental indicators. But these are usually unable to correlate environmental sustainability and economic growth. A weakness of many existing methods of assessing sustainability is their lack of a systems approach, which regards the system being considered as a whole and accounts for the interactions among its subsystems. This is important because achieving a more sustainable society is a systems problem, where the environment, the economy and society are all interdependent. Coupled humanenvironmental systems have interactions among different systems that lead to trade-offs, e.g. reducing costs may cause a process to have higher emissions or lower efficiency. A non-systems approach focusing on single factors can usually be seen to be inadequate for assessing sustainability holistically. As noted earlier, for example, biophysical approaches focus mainly on environmental sustainability and neglect economic and social dimensions, while methods based on weak sustainability focus on economic factors and neglect the biophysical facets of sustainability. Clearly, the sustainability of a system needs to be assessed with a systems approach. Life cycle analysis is usually part of such an approach, as it identifies material and energy inputs and outputs of a system or process and uses this information to assess environmental, economic and social effects. Although there are environmental concerns regarding the project, it nonetheless is viewed as providing significant environmental benefits. The Red-Mediterranean-Dead Seas Canal project has been shown to be the type of large project that may contribute significantly to sustainability. The benefits, which in many ways drive its contribution to numerous facets of sustainability, are shown in fig. 8. Surveys also indicate examples of common applications of sustainability, and these typically show that there is a strong focus on the implementation of sustainability concepts, actions, by both individuals and corporations. For example, the present author recently examined the actions of engineering practitioners regarding sustainability (Rosen 2013). Some specific findings were that the main sustainable technology priorities are using less energy and natural resources, reducing emissions and material wastes, and utilizing renewable, recyclable and recycled materials, and that challenges to sustainability exist, like economics viability. A breakdown of the degree of involvement of engineers with   sustainability or sustainable technologies showed that more than two-thirds of engineers are involved to some degree in sustainability, usually by working on sustainable products and processes. Also, the factors most likely to influence an organization's use of green design practices and procedures are regulatory requirements, client demand and rising energy costs (fig. 9).",
          "Although sometimes vague and often complex, sustainability is an important aim for societies and humanity. Sustainability is a multidimensional concept, encompassing economic, social, environmental and other factors. Sustainability assessment tools are needed to evaluate processes and systems, and how changes affect their sustainability. This usually necessitates a comprehensive set of indicators of the sustainability of the environment, the economy, technology, society, and institutional systems. Many human civilizations in the past proved to be unsustainable to some degree. It is hoped that the coverage provided in this chapter, including sustainability definitions and historical contexts, its economic, environmental and social dimensions, sustainable development, sustainability assessment measures and relevant applications, will assist efforts to address sustainability challenges today and, as an even more important priority, in the future.
