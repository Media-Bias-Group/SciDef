        "section": "The prevalence of false information on social media may strengthen the role of accuracyoriented motivations and the dimension of veracity for understanding news sharing behavior. People may worry about damaging their reputation by accidentally sharing fake news (Altay, Hacquin and Mercier 2019). To the extent such reputational worries induce accuracy-oriented social media behavior, we should expect that sharing fake news stories is a rare phenomenon relative to sharing real news, but also that the predictors of sharing fake versus real news will differ. Successfully discerning between fake and real news is difficult, first, because fake news is specifically designed to appear real and, second, because the fast-paced social media platforms deplete attention and cognitive resources (Pennycook et al. 2020). Accordingly, individual differences in the ability to detect cues about information veracity should largely determine whether people share fake news (Pennycook and Rand 2019b). In essence, from this perspective, fake news sharing happens because people are ignorant that the stories they share are false and, accordingly, below we refer to this argument as the ignorance theory. Goal-oriented motivations, however, may also critically shape sharing of political news on social media. As noted above, goal-oriented motivations affect information sharing during periods of social conflict. Politics is conflictual, but political conflict in the United States in recent years has been deepened by an increasing political polarization (Mason 2018). Goaloriented motivations put a premium on the usefulness of information. Sharing a political news story (fake or real) can be used to signal one's political affiliation, by denigrating political opponents or by mobilizing politically like-minded peers. In this regard, fake news stories can be particularly useful: as fake news is not constrained by reality, they can be excessive in their negative portrayal of political opponents (Acerbi 2019). Accordingly, to the extent goal-oriented motivations dominate social media users' interactions with news stories, the same psychological motivations should drive the sharing of real and fake news. People will share useful news that fits their political goals, and, in the extreme case, they will not pay attention to the veracity dimension of the information at all. In current American politics, two types of social or political goals could be served by sharing extreme information such as fake news. First, sharing news stories could reflect motivations to help one's preferred party against opposing parties in the increasingly polarized electoral competition (Iyengar, Sood andLelkes 2012, Lelkes andWestwood 2017). We will refer to this as the polarization theory as it focuses on partisan feelings rather than ideological disagreements between partisans of different stripes. The theory is prominent in current discussions about political events, like elections and referenda, and it has a long research history in political science (Mason 2018, Taber andLodge 2006). The theory has also informed studies on partisans' beliefs in political conspiracies (Miller, Saunders and Farhart 2015). Second, sharing news stories could be fueled by deep-seated discontent with the status quo and serve a desire to disrupt the existing social and political order. For example, Tucker et al. (2017, 53) convincingly argue that \"social media can lend a voice to ... anti system forces that actively seek to undermine liberal democracy.\" Below, we will refer to this as the disruption theory. Finally, there are also multiple scenarios for the intermediate (and likely) case where both veracity and usefulness considerations are relevant for social media users' sharing behavior. People may first evaluate the veracity of news and then, conditional on it being accurate, consider its usefulness. Or people may prioritize usefulness but still pay some attention to the veracity. Hence, the sharing of blatantly false information may, for example, complicate mobilization processes by derailing discussions about whether events really happened (Petersen, Osmundsen and Tooby 2020). Thus, when assessing usefulness, people may factor in veracity and selectively share information that is as extreme as they believe they can get away with. To elucidate whether and how the ignorance, polarization, and disruption theories account for the sharing of fake news, we use two approaches: First, we examine the role of individual differences, deducing for each theory who should be most likely to share fake news and, second, we examine the role of news story content, deducing what is most likely to be shared.",

        "section": "Kempner's research is based on an interview study that examines \"forbidden knowledge,\" a term used to capture scientists' decisions not to produce research because they believe it to be taboo, too contentious, or politically sensitive (a type of negative knowledge in the terminology introduced above). In 2002-2003, she and colleagues conducted ten pilot and forty-one in-depth, semistructured telephone interviews with a sample of researchers drawn from prestigious U.S. universities and representing a diverse range of disciplines, including neuroscience, microbiology, industrial/organizational psychology, sociology, and drug and alcohol research (Kempner, Perlis, and Merz 2005). Those fields were chosen to gauge the range, rather than the prevalence, of experiences with forbidden knowledge. Interviews lasted between thirty-five and forty-five minutes and were audiotaped, transcribed, coded, and analyzed according to the principles of grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin 1990). While many social movements organize around the identification and completion of undone science, others devote themselves to making sure that some kinds of knowledge are never produced. They are not alone. The idea that some knowledge ought to be forbidden is deeply embedded in Western cultures and appears in literature through the ages, from Adam and Eve's expulsion in Genesis to Dr. Frankenstein's struggle with a monster of his own creation (Shattuck 1996). Mertonian rhetoric aside, most people agree that some science poses unacceptable dangers to research subjects or to society at large. The widely accepted Nuremberg Code, for example, places strict limits on human experimentation, in an effort to ensure that some science-such as Nazi human experimentation in World War II-is never done again. Determining which knowledge ought to remain undone can often be contentious, as illustrated by current high-profile public debates surrounding the ethics and implications of stem cell research and cloning technologies. Nevertheless, as in research agenda-setting arenas (Hess 2007), debates and decisions about what knowledge should remain off limits to the scientific community typically occur among elites: legislators and federal agencies perennially issue guidelines and mandates regarding which research should not be conducted, setting limits on everything from reproductive and therapeutic cloning to studies of the psychological effects of Schedule I drugs, like heroin and marijuana. Scientists and the lay public both have limited opportunities to voice their opinion in these discussions. In dramatic cases, scientists have attempted to preempt mandates via self-regulation, as was the case in 1975 when scientists meeting at Asilomar called for a moratorium on certain kinds of recombinant DNA research (Holton and Morrison 1979). According to the forty-one elite researchers interviewed for this case study, these formal mechanisms account for only a portion of the limitations that can produce undone science (Kempner, Perlis, and Merz 2005). More often, researchers described how their research had been hamstrung by informal constraints-the noncodified, tacit rules of what could not be researched or written. Yet researchers were very clear about what constituted \"forbidden knowledge\" in their respective fields. The boundaries of what could not be done had been made known to them when either they or a colleague's work had been targeted for rebukein essence, their work had breached an unwritten rule. The management of forbidden knowledge, thus, worked much as Durkheim said it would: once someone's research had been identified as especially problematic by, for example, a group of activists, their work became a \"cautionary tale,\" warning others \"not to go there\" (Kempner, Bosk, and Merz 2008). In this way, social movement organizations and activists are able to play an important role in debates about what ought to remain undone, whether or not they are invited to the table. Besides their influence on shaping research agenda-setting arenas, social movements can and do influence individual researchers' decisions not to pursue particular types of studies. In recent decades, for example, animal rights organizations have had an enormous influence on the kinds of research that scientists choose not to produce. We found that the researchers in our sample who work with animal models took seriously the threat posed by those organizations. They spoke of \"terrorist-type attacks\" and told stories of colleagues who received \"razor blades in envelopes\" and \"threatening letters.\" Others faced activists who staked out at their houses. Researchers learned from these cautionary tales and, in many cases, said that they had self-censored as a result. One researcher, for example, explained that he would not work with primates-only \"lower order\" animals like mice and drosophilia because: I would like to lunatic-proof my life as much as possible … I, for one, do not want to do work that would attract the particular attention of terrorists … The paranoia was acute. One researcher refused to talk to the interviewer until she proved her institutional affiliation: \"For all I know, you are somebody from an animal rights organization, and you're trying to find out whatever you can before you come and storm the place.\" Over time, the overt interventions of animal rights organizations in the production of research have redefined the ethics of animal research, ushering in legislation like the Animal Welfare Act of 1985, which requires research institutions that receive federal funding to maintain \"Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees\" (Jasper and Nelkin 1992). However, lay groups do not need to use such directly confrontational tactics to influence researchers' decisions, especially if the groups are successful in their attempts to reframe a particular social problem. For example, substance abuse researchers argued that their research agendas were limited by the success of the Alcoholics Anonymous' campaign to define treatment for alcoholism as lifelong abstinence from drink. Although these researchers would like to conduct \"controlled drinking\" trials, in which alcoholics are taught to drink in moderation, they argued that \"There's a strong political segment of the population in the United States that without understanding the issues just considers the goal of controlled alcohol abuse to be totally taboo.\" The mere threat of interference from the grassroots was enough to keep many researchers from conducting certain studies. Several drug and alcohol researchers described great unwillingness to conduct studies on the health benefits of \"harm reduction\" programs, such as those that distribute free condoms in schools or clean needles in neighborhoods, because they might attract unwanted controversy from lay groups who oppose such public health interventions. Thus, in some contrast to the role that social movement organizations and lay experts/citizen scientists play in exposing undone science and encouraging knowledge creation in chemical, air monitoring, and breast cancer research, this study shows that the same actors can also play a powerful role in determining which knowledge is not produced. Moreover, conflict over the direction of funding streams, while critically important to the political of research agenda setting, do not solely determine what science is left undone. Rather, social movements are also effective beyond research agenda-setting processes that occur at the institutional level; this study provides evidence that they also shape the microlevel interactional cues and decision-making process of individual scientists. Although more research is needed to understand the circumstances under which researchers decide to selfcensor in response to pressure from outside groups, this case suggests that social movements may have much greater potential to thwart research than originally thought. The implications are intriguing and deserve greater attention. On one hand, disempowered groups may leverage these techniques to gain a voice in a system of knowledge from which they are typically excluded. On the other hand, it is troubling to learn that the subsequent \"chilling effect\" happens privately, often without public discussion and in response to intimidation and fear.",

        "section": "In order to understand how NFD rules influence the CSR activities of firms, we conducted statistical analyses that compared firms in three 'early adopter' countries (France, the UK and Denmark) with other OECD countries, as well as taking into account the changes within these countries over time. These three countries were first among the OECD to introduce NFD regulation with an explicit focus on the social dimension. In this context, mandatory disclosure is defined as regulation concerning the disclosure of social activities that applies to a broad segment of privately-owned stock exchange-listed corporations. We excluded cases where regulation applied only to state-owned companies, as in Sweden since 2007. We also excluded disclosure regulation limited to hazardous environmental risks, as found in the Netherlands or the US. Spain is an ambiguous case, since its 2011 government regulation only recommends (rather than mandates) disclosure (González and Vílchez, 2015). Similar requirements were also introduced by Norway in 2013, but this only covers one year during our observation period. In the EU, Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial disclosure required all member states to transpose the Directive into their national legislation before December 2016. This development will change the picture of CSR disclosure and makes our analysis timely. Our statistical analysis makes use of the Thomson Reuters Asset4 ESG database, which measures firm-level corporate responsibility activities. This database has already been validated in the CSR literature (Eccles et al., 2014;Cheng et al., 2014;Hawn and Ioannou, 2016;Rathert, 2016). Recently, it has increasingly been used in studies published in the Journal of Business Ethics (Al-Shaer and Zaman, 2017; Aouadi and Marsat, 2016;Benlemlih et al., 2018). Asset4 functions as a financial intermediary providing investment information related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues; it systematically collects information from company reports, company websites, and other sources, such as newspapers and nongovernmental organizations. In addition, firm-level financial data were obtained through Thomson Reuters DataStream. Our sample of firms consisted of stock exchange-listed corporations during the period 2002-2014. This covers the time before and after the implementation of non-financial disclosure rules in Denmark and the UK. However, the very early introduction of policies in France during the 1980s predates the existence of any source of comparable international CSR data. We reported our results for 24 OECD countries that had a sample size of 10 firms or more per year during the period of observation. Moreover, and to make the countries more comparable, we restricted our sample to companies responsible for 90% of total market capitalisation per year in countries with more than 100 companies, namely Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US. Table 2 shows the countries and average annual number of firms included in our analysis. The annual number of companies used in the analysis varied slightly from year to year owing to missing values. In total, our sample contains 19,709 firm-year observations. For our analysis, and as suggested by (Fransen, 2013), we examined CSR activities in a disaggregated fashion, focusing solely on those related to social issues. We devised a CSR measurement based on 36 items published by Asset4 that measure the presence or absence of policies related to social issues, as well as whether or not companies have taken specific action to implement these policies. 1 We included corporate activities across seven sub-dimensions of the social pillar: prod- Moreover, we created a second index based on a coding of corporate controversies and scandals across a similar range of issues (see Error! Reference source not found.). Examples of social pillar controversies include irresponsible activities linked to business ethics in general, political contributions, bribery, and corruption. Whereas CSR data are largely based on self-reporting by companies and tend to be almost complete, the Asset4 ESG Controversy Score measures companies' exposure to irresponsible activities and negative events (and their progress) as reflected in global media (e.g. scandals, lawsuits, ongoing legislative disputes or fines). Thus, though all ethical questions are discursive, some are already discursively more settled and might be involved in court cases, whereas others are still 'only' being discussed in the media. Consequently, nearly 50% of firms scored zero as regards CSiR, reflecting a potential underreporting bias. The resulting variables for CSR and CSiR ranged from 0 to 100, expressing the percentage of measured activities in relation to the possible maximum. Missing data was excluded from the analysis. We tested H1a and H1b using the CSR index, and H2 using the CSiR index. We also calculated one additional dependent variable. To test H3a and H3b, we created a measure of variation in the CSR activities between firms. A ratio of the spread of CSR activities reflects the distance between each firm and the median CSR activity level in each country in each year. The main independent variable was a country-level indicator of NFD policies developed by using information published by the Hauser Institute for Civil Society. The institute has collected cross-national information on NFD regulation going back to the 1970s. We used this to build a binary NFD variable indicating whether a country had implemented mandatory non-financial disclosure requirements (1) or not (0). As mentioned earlier, we focused explicitly on the impact of NFD legislation on the social activities of a wide range of stock exchange-listed companies. In our analyses, we included several firm-level control variables (Jackson and Apostolakou, 2010;Koos, 2012;Padgett and Galan, 2010). First, we expected that CSR activities would increase with firm size, measured here by the logged number of employees. Second, financial performance might positively influence CSR through the availability of resources, so we measured financial performance according to return on assets (pretax income as a percentage of total assets, winsorized values in the 1 st and 99 th percentile). We also included a ratio of total debt to total assets to capture financial constraints on CSR activities owing to indebtedness. Third, CSR might also be influenced by the degree of innovation, in view of greater future business opportunities or the need to justify new products in the eyes of customers. Thus, we included the level of R&D spending as a percentage of total assets. To acknowledge possible reverse causality of firm characteristics, these variables were lagged by one year. In general, the coefficients of the control variables were consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we included industry fixed effects based on a supersector industry classification benchmark (ICB) to control for sectoral differences that affect CSR activities and year dummies to account for the observed trend towards increasing levels of CSR. Finally, we added country dummies to control for wider institutional differences between countries. All firm-level control variables were obtained from financial data collected by Thomson Reuters DataStream. A key consideration in our study was whether our CSR index would be suitable to capture the effects of NFD regulation. Broad requirements for disclosure do not necessarily lead to the adoption of specific policies or implementation activities. However, a com-pany might previously have adopted a CSR-related policy, but only begin to provide explicit information to the public about this after disclosure has become mandatory. In this sense, the measurement would capture the shift from an implicit to a more explicit form of CSR, but not necessarily a change in corporate activities. In order to control for this type of confounding, we controlled for firm-level adoption of GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standards as an indicator of the quality of reporting. Consequently, we argue that it is unrealistic to reduce differences in our measured CSR index to differences in reporting, but we have interpreted these to reflect changes in actual CSR activities. To model the impact of NFD regulation between the years 2002 and 2014, we adopted different general linear squares (GLS) random effects models; these enabled us to test our hypotheses using robust standard errors clustered by company. Random effects estimations are appropriate since our key explanatory variable for NFD regulation does not vary much over time (Wooldridge, 2010). All estimations were carried out using STATA 12.1 and 15.0.",

        "section": "Our findings regarding media selection bias suggested that media agendas can drive the selection of protest events that are reported, independently of the numbers or activities of protesters themselves. In other words, \"objective\" matters such as the demonstration's size and characteristics have little bearing on whether or not the event is reported in the mass media. This appears increasingly true in more recent years, and is especially the case in television news reporting. Thus, social movement agents seeking to influence media agenda-setting cannot simply rely on generating large numbers of protesters or on engaging in unusual forms of collective action. Rather, they must also consider how their issue might be tied to media issue cycles. In other words, rather than simply reflecting \"objective\" occurrences, the operations and procedural logics of mass media institutions are important predictors of what events get reported. The practical need to select a limited number of issues on which to report leads to claims of selection bias in how editors and reporters go about the business of determining the news that is \"fit to print.\" Since they are, by definition, \"outsiders\" to political institutions and processes, social movements are typically marginalized by mainstream media routines. Once they achieve media attention to their protest event, demonstrators often find that the coverage of their protest fails to portray their cause as they would have liked. Often the more unruly activists are highlighted or the most vocal leaders advanced by reporters seeking images that they hope will appeal to their mass readership {Gitlin, 1980}. The specifics of protesters' policy concerns or the organizational details involved are largely irrelevant to those reporting on public protests. This may be a function of media gatekeepers, whose motivations, routines, and professional interests support the status quo. It may also result from the failure of many social movement challengers to engage in conscious efforts to wage an \"insider media game\" {Ryan, 1990 #xxx :5}. Plagued with limited staff, time, and money and with the inherently contradictory necessity of simultaneously appealing to constituents, publics, and targets, social movement actors often lack media strategies. Ryan (1990) summarizes the main theoretical models of news production routines according to: gatekeeper models which focus on daily operations and routines of media institutions; political economy or propaganda models, which explain media routines according to broad socioeconomic forces including media ownership patterns; and cultural studies, which emphasizes the role of mass media in maintaining the political and social hegemony of elites {Ryan 1990 #xxx : 22-25}. Clearly the operations of and influences on the mass media as well as the consequences of how the news is received are of interest to social movement researchers and activists. And recent media research suggests that a dynamic, process-oriented approach will best explain how the news is produced and to what consequence {#xxx see, e.g. Clayman, 1998; OTHER CITATIONS HERE?}. Gatekeeper Model. Gatekeeper models presume that in order to understand how social movements interact with the mass media, we must account for the institutional logics that shape how mass media operate. This approach might also be called the \"newsmaking approach,\" as it sees the mass media as not simple mirrors that reflect what goes on in society, but rather as actors in and of themselves that construct images and compile messages {Kielbowitz, 1986 #xxx :75}. Viewing media institutions as news makers leads one to account for how they determine what constitutes a newsworthy event. Social movements are faced with the dilemma of justifying why some chronic problem such as poverty or racial injustice is more worthy of attention today than it was yesterday. In other words, those seeking to raise routine issues onto media agendas must portray these issues as changing or somehow exceptionally interesting in order to mesh with media newsgathering routines. The identification and use of sources is another area where gatekeeper models help us understand media routines. Gans {#xxx 1979} and others have pointed out the institutional logic behind the decisions about deploying reporters and selecting sources --all of which work against the access of social movements to the mass media. Editors favor reporters who are generalists rather than specialists in the area on which they write, because generalists are cheaper, easier to control, and they are more reliant on their sources for information (thus removing responsibility from the media organization). A preference for government and official experts as sources derives from the ease of reaching their centralized press offices and the norm that has evolved of viewing government sources as credible and unbiased, requiring no routine fact-checking or corroboration. The reliance on government sources thus both reduces the costs of newsgathering and limits the risks {Herman, 1995}. It also tends to reproduce the agendas of these sources {Gans, 1979; Kielbowitz, 1986}. The need to understand media logics and to find ways to mesh with media news gathering routines means that movements whose leaders provide the most appealing media images and rhetoric will be the most likely to gain media coverage {Gitlin, 1980}. Movements, moreover, need to provide consistent streams of images that appeal to the mass media in order to sustain media focus on the issues. This leads activists to escalate their tactics in an ongoing effort to create \"new\" hooks for media attention {Kielbowitz, 1986}. Social movement actors have long recognized that generating media attention requires the creation of an event that is somehow \"newsworthy.\" Social movements have traditionally relied on public demonstrations --among other activities --to attract media attention that might further their aims and amplify their issues on social agendas. However, the tactics that are most likely to attract media attention are not often those that win respectability among the legislative and governmental targets that movement actors ultimately hope to influence {Gamson, 19xx}. Propaganda Model. Propaganda models generally assume that the structure of media ownership leads to an inherent bias in the mass media in favor of capitalist interests. Scholars adopting this perspective such as Edward Herman have argued that the privatization and commercialization of broadcasting during the 1970s and 1980s has severely constrained access to the mass media and limits the range of ideas conveyed through them {Herman, 1995 #xxx: 169}. The \"free market model\" outlined by Herman sees market forces \"naturally\" marginalizing dissent by crowding out any ideas for which there is no substantial economic backing, or \"effective demand.\" The commercialization of the airwaves restricts democratic access to the mass media by: 1) limiting media control to those with the large amounts of capital required to purchase and run large corporate structures that control media networks; 2) creating a market where reliance on advertising is essential to media operations; 3) driving the search for cost-effective news production, where the crucial need for cheap, \"credible\" sources leads editors to favor centralized government sources over hard to gather dissident sources that (unlike government sources) require fact-checking; 4) creating a fear of \"flak\" or \"negative feedback\" that imposes costs on or threatens the media, often leading to self-censorship i ; and 5) reinforcing ideological premises that favor capitalist institutions such as private property, the merits of free enterprise, the threat of state ownership and intervention, the benevolent role of the government in international affairs, and anti-communism. \"One of the great merits of this system of control is that it operates so naturally, without collusion or explicit censorship, merely by the decentralized pursuit of a set of micro-interests. It 'just works that way'\" {Hermann, 1995 #xxx :170}. One effect of the corporate control of media institutions is that news production becomes dependent upon what advertisers will support. When they buy air time, sponsors align their products with certain images. As consumers demanding services from news production agencies, advertisers can withold support of certain kinds of news programming. For instance, the portrayal of news about the Persian Gulf war was shaped to make it more appealing to advertisers: Pressure from advertisers led to the proliferation of upbeat \"home front\" stories of the war as network executives sought to assuage the worries of their sponsors. For instance, CBS executives \"offered advertisers assurances that the war specials could be tailored to provide better lead-ins to commercials' with 'patriotic views from the home front '\"{Andersen, 1995 #xxx:211, Quoted from Carter 1991}. While this kind of influence over programming may be good for business, it does little to advance peoples' understandings of complex social and political issues. And it divides the agendas of social change agents even further from those of the news media, which --in theory --serves as the public's \"watchdog\" against abuses by government, business and other elites. The propaganda model would lead one to expect little if any media coverage of social movements that threaten the capitalist order. And whatever coverage such movements might attain would be expected to marginalize or otherwise de-politicize their messages. One additional theme in the propaganda perspective is the focus on the increasing centralization of mass media institutions into corporate structures that control other aspects of social and economic life. The emergence of media monopolies has serious implications for the free exchange of ideas. With a media environment that is relatively free of competition, there are smaller news holes and fewer incentives to seek out innovative stories. This further threatens social movement access to the mass media {Kielbowitz, 1986}. Cultural Studies Model. Like propaganda models, cultural studies models of media operations explain the choices made in the selection and interpretation of the news in terms of broader power relations. The focus of these models, however, is more upon the subtle ways in which economic and political elites control images and meaning. According to these perspectives, the conveyance of information is used to reinforce ideas and interpretations of events that support existing power structures. Such models would lead us to expect that mass media coverage of social movements, particularly those that promote ideas that differ most strongly from dominant ideologies, will tend to marginalize social movement agendas. One way that this done is by framing stories in a way that suggests individualized or non-systemic causes and solutions to problems on which social movement activists work. Iyengar's {1991} field experiments led him to support the ideas in the cultural studies model; he concluded that how the media portray a problem affects public attributions of blame and their presumptions about appropriate solutions. Iyengar's study begins with the assumption that news stories can be categorized as either \"episodic\" or \"thematic\" in nature. Episodic news frames are event-oriented, and they focus on concrete issues such as an individual welfare mother or a terrorist bombing. In contrast, thematic news frames provide information that helps contextualize social problems, focusing more on general trends and conditions that set the stage for more dramatic events such as terrorist attacks. \"The essential difference between episodic and thematic framing is that episodic framing depicts concrete events that illustrate issues, while thematic framing presents collective or general evidence\" (Iyenger 1991:14). Thematic coverage in Iyengar's study was associated with systemic attributions of blame, while episodic coverage typically led subjects to see individuals as responsible for the problem at hand. Relating this idea to the relationship of social movements to the mass media, we note that social movements often seek to attract media attention to some broad social concern by generating an event that may be newsworthy in itself. But this demands that the coverage of the protest event focuses on the issues the movement seeks to address, rather than on the event used to attract media coverage. By creating a newsworthy event or episode, movement leaders hope to draw attention to underlying themes of injustice, inequality, or oppression. Social movements address chronic social problems that they attribute to some abstract, systemic cause. In order to appeal to the mass media and the general public, they must find ways to link these chronic problems with some more concrete, tangible event or focus. In other words, they must try to repackage what they see as an ongoing, systemic problem (e.g., poverty, racism) into an \"acute\" issue that demands urgent attention on a crowded social agenda {see Rochon, 1997 #xxx :178-9}. Movements generally seek support for their claims that the political and/or economic system is the source of some problem and that without systematic reforms the problem will persist. ii Thus, we would expect that more thematic --rather than episodic --coverage of their issues best advances the aims of social movement actors. Moreover, because they use protest events as \"pegs\" on which a news story might be based, we would expect to see a tendency towards more episodic reporting of social movement protests.",

In the year 2000, the average cable system included over 28 channels in the Basic and Expanded Basic programming. The mean total population reached by a cable system was 78,124, with a median of 23,921. The mean town population was 9,612 people, with a median of 2,766. As Census controls, we include in our regressions the share of the population with some college, the share of college graduates, the share of African Americans and of Hispanics, the unemployment rate, and the share of the town that is urban (shown in Table 1). In addition, we include the share of high school graduates, the share of males, the marriage rate, the employment and the unemployment rate, average income, and the share of the population living in an urban area (not shown in Table 1). These controls are present both in their 2000 value, and in changes between 1990 and 2000. Finally, the political variables are the two-party vote share for Republicans in Presidential elections (1996 and 2000) and the total turnout in Presidential elections measured as log share of the voting-age population, t j0 k,t (1996 and 2000). Columns 2 and 3 compare towns that offered Fox News in their programming (Column 2) and towns that did not (Column 3). Towns that offer Fox News have a substantially higher number of channels offered (44.5 versus 24.7), are 25 percent larger, are served by cable companies that reach three times as many people, and are more likely to be urban. More importantly, towns that offered Fox News by 2000 increased their Republican vote share by 5.9 percentage points (from 47.9 percent to 53.8 percent) between 1996 and 2000, while those that did not offer Fox News increased theirs by an even larger 7.1 percentage points (from 46.7 percent to 53.8 percent). These figures suggest a perverse Fox News effect. This result, however, does not weight towns by size, nor does it take into account differences between Fox and non-Fox towns in voting trends across geographical areas, demographic composition, and cable market. Below, we estimate the Fox News effect taking into account all these factors. The overall sample spans 235 congressional districts, out of 435 total 14 . Out of these 235 14 For the towns that are in multiple districts, we code the town as belonging to the district where the largest districts, 152 districts include both towns that offered Fox News and towns that did not. In our difference-in-difference specification with district fixed effects, the effect of Fox News is estimated on these districts. The median district in this subsample of 7,631 towns offers Fox News in 20.4 percent of towns (Columns 4 and 5 of Table 2). Towns in this subsample are smaller but otherwise comparable to the overall sample. We also consider the distribution of Fox News at the finer geographical level of the county. Only 284 counties out of 1,156 incorporate both towns with Fox News and towns without. These counties are more concentrated in the Northeast and less in the South (Figure 1). In our specification with county fixed effects, the effect of Fox News is estimated on the 3,890 towns in these counties. The median county in this subsample offers Fox News in 40.4 percent of towns. Towns with Fox News (Column 6 of Table 2) and without Fox News (Column 7) in this subsample are close geographical neighbors and therefore more closely matched on observables, such as demographic and voting characteristics.",

        "section": "Another essential category of narrative elements is the participants. They are the \"who\" of the story, relevant to the \"what\" and the \"why\". Participants, sometimes also referred to as actors, are involved in events in a varied number of ways and often correspond to entities in NLP. These, are usually identified through Named Entity Recognition (NER), a generic task aiming at seeking, locating and categorizing the entities mentioned in the text into predefined categories. Although the three most common named entities are person, organization, and location, further types such as numeric expressions (e.g., time, date, money, and percent expressions) can also be considered (Nadeau and Sekine 2007). In narrative terms, participants are more frequently restricted to the person and organization categories, though other categories such as animals may also be used. In our running example this would result in annotating \"John\" and \"audience\" as a person, and \"rabbit\" as an animal as can be observed in Fig. 7. Overall, research on named entity recognition can be categorized into four main categories: rule-based approaches, unsupervised learning approaches, feature-based supervised learning approaches, and deep-learning-based approaches (Li et al. 2022). Beyond this, other aspects, such as textual genres, entity types, and language, are also considered by research conducted on named entity identification (Goyal et al. 2018). The current stateof-the-art in named entity recognition was obtained by Wang et al. (2021) on the CoNLL 2003NER task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder 2003). To automate the process of finding better concatenations of embeddings for structured prediction tasks, the authors proposed Automated Concatenation of Embeddings (ACE) based on a formulation inspired by recent progress on neural architecture search. The method achieved an F1-score of 94.60%. In narrative contexts, Lee et al. (2021) present a proposal that goes beyond the identification of entities in narratives, proposing a multi-relational graph contextualization to capture the implicit state of the participants in the story (i.e., characters' motivations, goals, and mental states). Piper et al. (2021) point out that NLP works focusing on agents have emphasized broadening the understanding of characters beyond named entities. This has been done through the concept of animacy detection, as in agents like \"the coachman\" or \"the frog\", while also distinguishing characters from other named referents (Piper et al. 2021). According to Oza and Dietz (2021)'s proposal, selecting a set of relevant entities for a story construction could be best achieved by using entity co-occurrences in retrieved text passages -especially when the relative relevance of passages is incorporated as link strength. In line with what the authors claim, their proposal is between 80% and 30% more effective than the best link-based approach.",

          "(d) women, as compared with men, reject HS but often accept BS, a tendency most pronounced in more sexist cultures, where women may experience heightened needs for the protection, idealization, and affection BS promises, and (e) national HS and BS averages predict variation in gender inequality across nations.",
          "Cross-culturally, women, relative to men, are a disadvantaged group, as indicated by, for example, differences in earnings and the low percentage of women in the most powerful roles in business and government (United Nations Development Programme, 1998). Nevertheless, Eagly and Mladinic (1994) found that women are actually stereotyped more positively than men are, with men as well as women attributing highly favorable traits (e.g., warmth and nurturance) to women. For an antipathy model of prejudice, the coexistence of women's general subordination and Eagly and Mladinic's \"women are wonderful\" effect is a paradox. One alternative is that women are viewed positively on some dimensions, such as warmth, and negatively on others, such as competence (Eagly & Mladinic~ 1994;Fiske, 1998;Fiske et al., 1999;Glick & Fiske, in press). Another related alternative is that subjectively favorable attitudes toward women can themselves be a form of prejudice in that they s~erve to justify and maintain women's subordination. Glick and Fiske (1996) hypothesized that hostile and benevolent attitudes toward women are complementary components of sexism common among past and present human societies. Apart from anecdotal evidence that polarized attitudes toward women (e.g., the virgin-whore dichotomy; Tavris & Wade, 1984) have existed since ancient times (see Pomeroy, 1975), sound theoretical reasons suggest that HS and BS are, and long have been, pervasive prejudices. Glick and Fiske (1996) argued that HS and BS stem from social and biological conditions common to human societies: patriarchy, gender differentiation, and sexual reproduction. Patriarchy (male dominance), varying considerably in degree, is widespread across cultures (Harris, 1991;Pratto, 1996), though not necessarily universal (see Salzman, 1999). Additionally, in most cultures, women and men are differentiated in that (to a greater or lesser extent) they often inhabit different social roles and occupations (Eagly & Wood, 1999) and are attributed different traits (Williams & Best, 1982). Finally, sexual reproduction is a biological constant that is related to social roles, as women's roles are largely defined by childbearing and child rearing (Eagly, 1987), and that promotes intimate relationships between men and women. Patriarchy, gender differentiation, and sexual reproduction combine to create HS and BS. Dominant groups, whether based on gender or other distinctions, inevitably propagate systemjustifying ideologies of their superiority, which are often accepted even by members of socially subordinate groups (Jost & Banaji, 1994; see also Jost & Burgess, 2000;Jost, Burgess, & Mosso, in press). Thus, men's dominance creates HS, hostile attitudes about women. This dominance is largely enacted in and reinforced by gender roles and stereotypes. Furthermore, men often exert their power over women within sexual relationships, and women can potentially counter men's power through sexuality (e.g., by using sexual attractiveness to control men). Therefore, concerns about power, gender differentiation, and sexuality are bound together as components of HS. In a modem context in which social move-ments and increasing gender equality threaten traditional male dominance, HS may be directed most strongly at women who challenge men's power (e.g., feminists) and status (e.g., career women), as well as toward women who are perceived as using their sexual allure to gain power over men (e.g., temptresses). However, sexual reproduction and men's dependence on women to fulfill domestic roles create a dependency and intimacy between the sexes that counterbalances sexist hostility with a subjectively benevolent view of women, BS. Although men dominate crossculturally, they rely on women to produce and to nurture offspring, for domestic labor, and to fulfill sexual and intimacy needs, lending women power in intimate relationships (Guttentag & Secord, 1983). This dependence, Glick and Fiske (1996) argued, precipitates subjectively benevolent but paternalistic attitudes toward women, as men \"can't live without them.\" BS is sexist in that it presumes women's inferiority (it recognizes and reinforces patriarchy by portraying women as needing men to protect and provide for them) hut is subjectively positive (from the perspective of the sexist perceiver) in that it characterizes (at least some) women as wonderful, pure creatures whose love is required to make a man whole. Like I-IS, BS encompasses attitudes related to power, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality. The 22-item Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI; Glick & Fiske, 1996), initially developed and validated in six studies (involving both college students and older adults) in the United States (Glick & Fiske, 1996), is a self-report measure of sexist attitudes composed of separate 11-item I-IS and BS subscales (see Appendix). HS is evidenced by an adversarial view of gender relations in which women are perceived as seeking to control men, whether through sexuality or feminist ideology. Potential HS items that baldly asserted women's inferiority were strongly rejected by respondents in the United States and were therefore not included in the scale. Thus, the I-IS scale is a relatively subtle and contemporary measure of sexist hostility. Nevertheless, given that the predominant theme is a hostile reaction to women challenging men's authority and power, we believe that it is an extension of, and is consistent with, traditional forms of sexist hostility; this belief is supported by moderate to strong correlations (Glick & Fiske, 1996) between HS and measures of blatant sexism such as the Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS; Spence & I-Ielmreich, 1972) and the Old-Fashioned Sexism Scale (Swim, Aikin, Hall, & Hunter, 1995). In contrast, BS items suggest that women are pure creatures who ought to be adored and placed on a pedestal but are also weak and in need of protection. Although the BS scale, because it represents a subtle form of prejudice, is sometimes lumped together with measures of uniquely contemporary forms of sexism such as Modem Sexism (MS; Swim et al., 1995) or Neo-Sexism (NS; Tougas, Brown, Beaton, & Joly, 1995), BS was never hypothesized to be a recent development (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Indeed, BS items have a much less contemporary flavor (e.g., the notion that women are more pure than men) than I-IS items do, perhaps because BS, because of its positive tone, has not been challenged as vigorously in egalitarian societies as has sexist hostility. Unlike the BS scale, the MS and NS measures assume that sexism is an antipathy but that the antipathy is disguised as political and social egalitarianism within cultures that promote this value. The attitudes tapped by the BS scale are not disguised as egalitarian; rather, they seem closer to medieval ideologies of chivalry (Tavris & Wade, 1984) than they are to contemporary \"political correctness.\" BS is rooted in the structure of personal relationships between men and women, not in public politics. The BS scale is correlated moderately strongly with HS, but once this relationship is controlled, it has strong discriminant validity, correlating weakly or not at all with fi variety of other measures of sexism based on an antipathy model, such as the AWS and the MS Scale (Glick & Fiske, 1996;Massel~ & Abrams, 1999). Three subdimensions, related to the underlying structural factors of patriarchy, gender differentiation, and sexual reproduction, consistently emerge as BS subfactors in factor analyses of the ASI: protective paternalism (e.g., women ought to be rescued first in emergencies), complementary gender differentiation (e.g., women are more pure than men), and heterosexual intimacy (e.g., every man ought to have a woman he adores). Although HS scale items also address power relations, gender differentiation, and sexuality, this scale has proven to be unidimensional (see Glick & Fiske, 1996, for speculations as to why this is the case). That HS and BS are complementary ideologies is suggested by their positive correlation. When this correlation is controlled statistically, however, HS predicts negative and BS predicts positive attitudes toward and stereotypes about women (Glick, Diebold, Bailey-Werner, & Zhu, 1997;Glick & Fiske, 1996), supporting the contention that BS is a subjectively positive form of prejudice. Although people who score high on both scales can be characterized as ambivalent toward women, they seem to reconcile their hostile and benevolent attitudes by classifying women into good and bad subtypes, evincing, for example, hostility toward career women and affection for homemakers (Glick et al., 1997). BS may help to legitimate HS by allowing sexist men to conceive of themselves as benefactors of women and to excuse their hostility as being directed only at women who allegedly deserve it. Furthermore, because BS fosters behaviors that are normally deemed prosocial, such as helping or protecting women, women tend to accept rather than challenge BS (Glick & Fiske, 1996;Kilianski & Rudman, 1998). The claim that BS is a form of sexism relies on the putative relationship of BS to the subordination of women. Jackman (1994) illuminated the greater effectiveness of paternalistic prejudices such as BS, as compared with outfight antipathy, in gaining compliance (rather than resistance) from low-status groups. Whereas HS serves to punish women who fail to conform to (male-defined) acceptable roles, BS represents the rewards women reap when they do conform (Glick et al., 1997). Women who embrace conventional, sanctioned roles are protected and revered. As any psychologist knows, reward is far more effective than punishment is in eliciting conformity. Thus, the combination of HS and BS may be particularly effective as complementary justifications or \"legitimating myths\" (Sidanius, Pratto, & Bobo, 1994, p. 999) that serve to maintain gender inequality. Jost and Banaji's (1994) system-justification theory suggests that subordinate groups often accept legitimizing myths that justify the status quo but that acceptance of such ideologies is tempered because overtly hostile ideologies about one's group contradict individual and group interests (Jost et al., in press). In contrast, prejudiced ideologies that are ostensibly benevolent may be seductive to subordinate group members, because they do not appear to contradict self-and group interests. Women may be attracted to BS more than to HS because it not only justifies the system as a whole but also promises rewards from the more powerful group (protection, adoration, intimacy). What may be particularly insidious is that women are likely to value these rewards more highly in cultures in which they perceive many men to be hostile. In highly sexist societies, men provide both the threat (HS) and the solution to the threat (BS and the protection, provision, and affection it promises); women in these societies are presented with a stark choice--reject BS and face the wrath of HS, or accept BS and avoid HS. In more egalitarian societies, women may be freer to reject BS as well as HS, because they are less likely to be as dependent on men for resources and because rejecting BS is not as likely to elicit sexist hostility.",
          "We have hypothesized that sexist prejudice is not expressed through antipathy alone, that HS and BS are complementary sexist ideologies that are common across cultures, and that BS, as well as HS, is related to the oppression of women. These claims--which currently lack supportive evidence and, as far as BS is concerned, can be viewed as contradicting well-established views of prejudice as an antipathy--can be tested rigorously only through crosscultural comparisons. Because the variation between countries in gender equality is measurable (United Nations Development Programme, 1998), cross-national comparisons not only afford a realistic test of the hypothesis that BS goes hand in hand with HS but also test the notion that both BS and HS are related to women's subordination (i.e., that BS is indeed a form of sexism). Specifically, we ask the following questions: (a) Do HS and BS exist--that is, can they be reliably and validly identified--across cultures? (b) As has been found in the United States, are HS and BS positively correlated among respondents within countries, and do average HS and BS scores covary across nations, indicating that HS and BS are mutually supportive sexist ideologies? (c) As in the United States, do HS and BS predict opposing valences in stereotypes about women, confirming that HS is an antagonistic and BS a subjectively favorable orientation toward women? (d) Are women (as compared with men) relatively more accepting of BS than of HS and, across nations, does women's (as compared with men's) acceptance of BS increase when men's sexism is more pronounced? and (e) Across cultures, is BS, as well as HS, related to objective measures of women's oppression, suggesting that both forms of sexism justify and maintain gender inequality?",
          "Researchers in 19 countries administered the ASI, translated in non-English-speaking countries. Even if HS and BS exist across cultures, the ASI scales could be culturally specific, having been developed and validated only in the United States. Cross-cultural psychologists (see Triandis & Marfn, 1983) distinguish between etics, which are universal phenomena, and emics, which are culturally specific (but which can be culture-specific markers for etics). In this terminology, it is possible that the constructs of HS and BS are emics, unique to the United States and possibly Europe (and related nations such as Canada and Australia). Theoretically, however, the constructs of HS and BS ought to be etics, as we have hypothesized that HS and BS originate in social and biological factors common to human groups. Nevertheless, the HS and BS scales might be emics that validly tap the wider constructs only in the United States. If this were the case, culturally specific measures of HS and BS would be necessary. Alternatively, the HS and BS scales may be good indicators of the hypothesized etics in a variety of cultures. From a pragmatic point of view, keeping the measures constant is highly desirable. Culture-specific measures would both be laborintensive to produce and result in comparisons that, though hoped to be appropriate at the level of the hypothesized etics, would be incommensurable at the operational level. Rather than presuming a priori that specific scale items would not generalize, we used the original items and designed our research to provide multiple tests of the validity of the scales by (a) gathering samples large enough to perform confirmatory factor analyses testing alternative models of the factor structure of the ASI--becanse the ASI's structure is complex, its replication would provide significant evidence not only for the coherence of the scale but also for its construct validity; (b) including, where possible, a predictive validity task in which respondents generated their spontaneous stereotypes of women and then rated the valence of each trait they generated, to test whether HS predicts negative and BS predicts positive trait valences; and (c) correlating, across countries, national means on HS and BS with the United Nations indices of national gender equality, on the basis of objective measures (e.g., percentage of professionals who are women, educational level of men and women).",

          "The ASI was filled out by over 15,000 respondents (both men and women) in 19 nations: Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States) Sample sizes ranged from about 250 to 1,600 respondents (with most samples having over 500 respondents). In some cases, several sampies were collected and combined within a country. In all but one case (the Netherlands), the samples cannot be presumed to be representative of the country in which they were gathered. In some countries (Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, England, Italy, Japan, Portugal, South Africa, Turkey, the United States) the respondents were exclusively college students, typically recruited in classes. In other countries, participants were more diverse: Almost all (90%) of the respondents in the Netherlands were from a representative national sample, and almost all (over 90%) of the male respondents and 50% of the female respondents in Spain were from community samples. Approximately 50% of the respondents in Australia and Botswana, 40% in South Korea, and a significant minority of respondents in Chile (25%), Germany (20%), and Nigeria (20%) were Older adults from more diverse backgrounds. Like most respondents, the countries were not randomly selected. Nevertheless, this set of nations represents considerable geographic, cultural, and economic diversity, as well as significant variation on the United Nations indices of national gender equality (the countries ranged from the 15th to the 95th percentile on the Gender Empowermeat Measure, or GEM, described in the following section).",
          "Researchers in each non-English-speaking country translated and back-translated the 22-item version of the ASI. The coauthors in each nation served as cultural informants about the appropriateness of individual ASI items, and many noted that reverse-worded items from the original ASI (which are framed as negative statements) did not typically translate well (a perception conf'n'rned by poor loadings on later factor analyses). Because some samples were collected with reversed wording and other, later samples were collected with nonreversed wording for these six items, the items were eliminated from all reported analyses, so that the measure was comparable across samples. 2 For future cross-cultural work, however, we recommend the full scale with nonreversed wording for all items, as reproduced in the Appendix. Stereotypes of women. In 12 countries, some or all participants generated, in a free-response format, up to 10 personality traits that most quickly came to mind as being characteristics the participant associates with women. Participants then indicated how negative or positive they thought each trait was by rating each trait on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from -3 (extremely negative) to 3 (extremely positive). The strength of this measure is that it assesses respondents' spontaneous stereotypes (rather than supplying a list of traits determined by the researcher, which might be appropriate for some cultures and not others) and allows respondents to define the subjective positivity or negativity of each trait. United Nations indices of gender equality. The United Nations Development Programme (1998) has published two objective indices of national gender equality. The GEM assesses women's (relative to men's) actual participation in the economy (percentage of administrators, managers, and professional and technical workers who are women, women's share of earned income) and in politics (percentage of parliament seats held by women). The larger the GEM, the more gender equality there is in a country's economic and political life. The Gender-Related Development Index (GDI) is a form of the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI), which focuses on longevity (life expectancy), knowledge (adult literacy rates, years of schooling), and standard of living (purchasing power). The GDI uses the same measures as the HDI, but the score is decreased for gender inequality (e.g., women having a lower literacy rate). The greater the gender disparity, the lower the GDI is relative to the HDI.",

          "If the ASI's complex factor structure replicates in various nations, this would support our contention that HS and BS are pervasive forms of sexism arising from common aspects of the human condition. Although in U.S. samples, the HS scale has proven to be unidimensional, the BS scale has consistently demonstrated three predicted subcomponents--protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy (Glick & Fiske, 1996). For each national sample, confirmatory factor analyses (using LISREL 8.0; Jtireskog & Stirbom, 1993) tested the fit of several alternative models: (a) a one-factor model (all items assess a general sexism factor--a plausible model, as HS and BS are typically positively correlated), (b) a two-factor model (the items load on separate, though correlated, HS and BS factors, but no BS Portions of the data from some countries are published elsewhere: Chile (Mladinic, Saiz, Diaz, Ortega, & Oyarce, 1998), Germany (Eckes & Six-Materna, 1999), South Korea (Kim, 1998), Spain (Exptsito, Moya, & Glick, 1998), and the United States (Glick & Fiske, 1996). 2 Glick and Fiske (1996) provided evidence that the relationship of the ASI to other sexism measures is similar when no items are reverse-worded, as compared with when some items are reverse-worded. Analyses in which the reverse-worded items were included for the current samples did not substantially change the ASI means, HS-BS correlations, or the ASI scales' relationships to other measures (e.g., the United Nations indices). subfactors are distinguished), (c) a 4-factor model (HS, protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy; this model treats the hypothesized BS subfactors as independent factors that are not nested within an overall BS factor), and (d) a preferred model (HS, in addition to BS with three subfactors). In the preferred model, BS encompasses the three subfactors (rather than treating them as independent factors). The preferred model is a stringent one in which the BS subfactors are restricted from correlating directly with HS. Because HS and BS are thought to be complementary aspects of sexism, however, these two general factors are allowed to correlate. The fit of the various models is shown in Table 1. The primary measure of model fit is the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), which is standardized on a 0-1 scale, allowing for direct comparisons across samples of differing sizes. Comparisons of the relative fit of different models within each sample, however, require the chi-square difference test (Bollen, 1989), which determines whether differences in fit are statistically significant. Because large samples are needed to achieve stable and accurate factor solutions (especially with the relatively complex model tested here), results for samples of fewer than 500 respondents should be considered potentially unstable. Using the chi-square difference test, we compared the alternative models (one-factor, two-factor, and four-factor) with the preferred model (HS, in addition to BS with three subfactors, which past research has established as the best fit in U.S. samples). In all but three nations, the preferred model was statistically superior to all of the alternative models, with chi-squares significant at p < .01. In Cuba and Japan, although the preferred model fit significantly better than the one-factor and four-factor models, it did not exceed the fit of the two-factor model, and in Colombia, the preferred model only exceeded the fit of the one-factor model. Overall, with few exceptions, the preferred model had the best fit (and in two of the three exceptional samples, Colombia and Cuba, the number of participants was fewer than the recommended minimum for performing factor analysis). In general, fits of the preferred model were within the range established previously in U.S. samples of similar size (GFIs in the low .90s for large samples and high .80s for small samples). In the United States, the fit of the preferred model has proven to be similar for both women and men. Among the current samples, there were nine of sufficient size (at least 300 participants of each gender: Brazil, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, Nigeria, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, the United States) to test the preferred model by fitting it simultaneously but separately for men and women (J6reskog & S6rbom, 1993). The most stringent test required the same parameters (i.e., identical factor loadings and factor correlations) for both genders. The GFIs for this comparison ranged from .88 (Spain) to .93 (the United States). Because HS-BS correlations have differed for men and women in some U.S. samples, we let the HS-BS factor correlations vary to achieve a better fit. These analyses yielded acceptable GFIs ranging from .90 (the Netherlands, Turkey) to .93 (Germany, the United States), indicating similar models for women and men with, in some cases, possible differences in HS-BS correlations (an issue explored in detail later in this article). Overall, the factor analytic results support the hypothesis that HS and BS are not specific to the United States but are coherent ideologies evident across cultures and that the ASI is a valid measure of these constructs, at least in the countries tested. Furthermore, the general superiority of the preferred model, as compared with the alternatives, suggests that (a) HS and BS are separate constructs (as shown by comparisons with the one-factor model), (b) BS has separable subfactors (as shown by comparisons with the two-factor model), and (c) the BS subfactors are best conceived as being nested within an overall BS scale (as shown by comparison with the four-factor model). a Fit is significantly better than all alternative models at p < .01. b Fit is significantly better than one-factor and four-factor models at p < .01. ¢ Fit is significantly better than one-factor model at p < .01. ",
          "The remaining analyses involve raw ASI scores (not factor scores). The unidimensional HS scale, with alphas ranging from .68 to .89, proved (as in prior U.S. samples) more internally consistent than the multidimensional BS subscale, for which alphas ranged from .53 to .84. We also examined the reliability of each BS subscale. Across countries, the mean alphas for each scale were .54 for protective paternalism, .61 for complementary gender differentiation, and .54 for heterosexual intimacy. Within each country, alphas for each of the BS subfactors were always lower than the alpha for the overall BS scale was. The alphas for BS were lowest in the three African samples and the Cuban sample (ranging from .53 to .57, with all other samples at .64 or higher). Item-total correlations in these cases did not suggest that any specific BS items were to blame; rather, most of the item-total correlations were weak. We do not believe that the low alphas are particularly worrisome, given that (a) BS is a multidimensional scale and therefore ought to show lower internal consistency (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955), and (b) the LISREL factor analyses, which are more sophisticated analyses of scale structure than alpha is and which correct for error variance, show extremely good fit for the preferred factor model for all three African countries (GFIs of .93 to .94) and acceptable fit for the (relatively small) Cuban sample (GFI = .87).",
          "In U.S. samples (with the exception of adult men in two small samples; Glick & Fiske, 1996), HS and BS are typically correlated in the .40 to .50 range, supporting the notion that although HS and BS are distinct (as factor analyses consistently show), they both are forms of sexism. Table 2 reports correlations between HS and BS scale scores within each country. The results are fairly consistent, with significant positive correlations appearing for both men and women in most countries, with the exception of men in Belgium, Botswana, Italy, Nigeria, and Portugal and both men and women in South Africa. In some U.S. samples, HS-BS correlations were stronger for women than for men, suggesting that men's hostile and benevolent attitudes may be more differentiated than women's (Glick & Fiske, 1996). Significant gender differences, with women's correlations higher than men's, occurred in 10 countries: Botswana, Cuba, England, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, and Turkey (see Table 2 for z tests). Comparing across the 19 nations, the average HS-BS correlation among men (r = .23) was significantly smaller than the average correlation for women (r = .37), t(18) = 5.02, p < .01. Despite these gender differences, the trend was toward significantly positive HS-BS correlations in most countries (13 of 19 for men, 18 of 19 for women). 3",
          "Prior research in the United States has shown that despite the positive oorrelatiorj between the scales, HS predicts negative and BS predicts positive attitudes toward and stereotypes about women. In 12 countries, some or all respondents were asked to 3 We also examined the correlations of each BS subscale with the HS scale, separately for women and men. The BS subfactors correlated weakly to moderately with HS. The correlations with HS averaged across countries were, for men and women respectively, .21 and .37 for Protective Paternalism, .14 and .28 for Complementary Gender Differentiation, and .20 and .26 for Heterosexual Intimacy. For the countries in which the HS-BS correlation was low for men, there was no discernable pattern such that any single subfactor accounted for the lack of HS-BS correlation (i.e., in these cases all BS subfactors were weakly, usually nonsignificantly, correlated with HS). generate up to 10 traits they associate with women and then rate each trait on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from -3 (extremely negative) to 3 (extremely positive). Often, this task was given only to a subset of respondents, so sample sizes are smaller for these analyses. For each respondent, the positive-negative ratings (of the Waits that the respondent associated with women) were averaged. Examples of traits generated include tender, warm, sweet, and sensitive (all positively valenced) and jealous, sly, touchy, and selfish (all negatively valenced). We expected that once the positive intelrelationslfip was partialed out, HS would predict negative and BS would predict positive trait ascriptions to women. Table 3 shows the partial correlations (each ASI subscale partialed from the other) of HS and BS to the average trait ratings. When male and female respondents were pooled together, the pattern of correlations was completely as we expected: HS correlated negatively and BS positively with trait ratings, with 22 of 24 correlations reaching statistical significance. Analyzing male and female respondents separately revealed less consistent results; although all significant correlations were in the predicted direction, only about two thirds of the correlations were statistically significant. These less consistent results may be the consequence of smaller sample sizes. The higher proportion of significant correlations for female participants may also be a function of sample size. In the two countries in which both the HS and the BS correlations were nonsignificant for men, the sample size was fewer than 50 male respondents, whereas sample sizes for women were two to three times larger. The majority of the correlations support the predictive validity of the HS and BS scales; when correlations were significant, HS predicted subjectively negative and BS subjectively positive stereotypes about women. 4",
          "Because the samples presented here (with the exception of the Netherlands) cannot be considered representative of the countries in which they were collected, due caution must be exercised when making cross-national comparisons of mean HS and BS scores. In addition, variations in interpretations of items because of cultural differences (even between English-speaking countries) and the inevitable slippage in translations no doubt make fine-grained analyses of mean differences a dubious enterprise. 5 Mean comparisons between men and women within each country, however, do not suffer from the problems just delineated. 6 In U.S. samples, men typically scored higher than women on HS, but the gender gap (though still significant) was mitigated for BS scores, presumably because HS punishes women, whereas BS potentially rewards them with protection, idealization, and affection. Means for each national sample on HS and BS ale presented in Figures 1 and2, respectively. In all countries, men scored significantly higher than women did on HS. In the vast majority of countries, however, the gender 4 We also examined, separately for women and men, the correlations of each BS subscale with the average trait valence, partialing out HS. The partial correlations with trait valence, averaged across countries, for men and women respectively, were .18 and .17 for Protective Paternalism, . 19 and .11 for Complementary Gender Differentiation,and .13 and .11 for Heterosexual Intimacy. There was no particular pattern such that any single subfactor accounted for the correlation of BS to trait valence. Moreover, a 1 to 7 (rather than the usual 0 to 5) rating scale was used in England. For mean analyses, a formula derived from Aiken (1987) was used to approximate a 0 to 5 scale: -.5 + 6 (score -.5)/7. 6 There was one exception to the comparability of men and women within each nation. The first sample of women gathered from Spain (n = 216) were third-year psychology students (rather than a community sample, as was the case with the men) who exhibited anomalously low scores on the ASI scales, particularly on HS (M = 1.09, over half a point lower than women in any other nation). Because of their advanced work in psychology (which included a week-long seminar on gender issues in the class in which they filled out the ASI), these students may have been particularly sensitive to the intent of the scale. As a result, a more diverse sample of 223 women (to match the community sample of Spanish men) were given the ASI, and we excluded the advanced female psychology students from all analyses involving mean comparisons or correlations of national means on the ASI scales. difference in BS scores was significantly less, disappeared, or even reversed itself such that in some countries women scored higher than men on BS. A 2 (gender of participant) × 2 (ASI subscale: HS, BS) analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each sample (with ASI subscale treated as a repeated measures factor) yielded a significant gender of participant main effect in all cases, all Fs > 4.28, p < .05, such that men exhibited higher scores when HS and BS were averaged together. In all but three countries (Australia, Japan, and the Netherlands), however, this main effect was qualified by a Gender of Participant X ASI Subscale interaction, all significant Fs > 13.05, p < .01. The nature of the interaction was of two types: (a) a large gender difference in HS scores became a smaller or nonsignificant gender difference in BS scores or (b) the gender difference was reversed for BS, such that women scored higher on BS than men did. The HS gender difference was statistically significant in all samples, all ts > 2.55, p < .01. The BS gender difference, smaller in magnitude, was nonsignificant in nine countries (Belgium, Chile, Colombia, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and Turkey). Furthermore, although in six countries (Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, and the United States), men scored significantly higher in BS than did women, all ts > 2.25, p < .05, the Gender of Participant x ASI Scale interactions indicate that in four of the six cases--with Australia and the Netherlands being the exceptions--the BS gender difference was significantly smaller than the HS gender difference. Finally, in Cuba and in the three African nations (Botswana, Nigeria, and South Africa), women's BS scores were actually higher than men's, all ts < -3.04, p < .01. In summary, cross-culturally, women (in comparison with men) rejected HS but often accepted BS, even to the point, in some nations, of endorsing BS significantly more strongly than men did.",
          "We had predicted that just as HS and BS typically go together at the level of individual respondents' attitudes, they would tend to go hand in hand at the national level of analysis. National means on HS correlated extremely strongly with mean BS scores, both among men, r = .89, p < .01, and among women, r = .89, p < .01. Thus, as we expected, in countries where the endorsement of HS was high, endorsement of BS was also high. The strength of these correlations supports the idea that HS and BS act as complementary forms of sexism. If the system-justification hypothesis that subordinates tend to accept ideologies promoted by dominant groups is correct, then men's level of sexism ought to predict women's agreement with sexist ideologies. Men's HS scores correlated highly with women's mean scores on HS, r = .84,p < .01, and on BS, r = .92,p < .01. Similarly, men's BS scores were highly correlated with women's average scores both on HS, r = .84, p < .01, and on BS, r = .97, p < .01. In other words, in countries where men were more sexist, women had a greater tendency to embrace sexist ideologies, both hostile and benevolent. Although this evidence is correlational, it is consistent with the system-justification hypothesis that members of subordinate groups adopt the system-justifying ideologies of dominant groups. It is important to keep in mind, however, that within each nation women, on average, uniformly endorsed HS to a lesser degree than men did. In contrast, even in those countries where women rejected BS more than men did, the BS scores typically showed less of a gender gap, and in four nations there was a reversal, with women scoring significantly higher than men did.",
          "The strength of the gender gap in HS and BS scores varied across countries. We had hypothesized that some of this variation would be systematic, in particular that women would be less likely, relative to men, to reject BS in cultures in which men are more highly sexist. In contrast, we hypothesized that as men's overall level of sexism increased across nations, the more likely it would be for the HS gender gap to increase, because for hostile ideologies, system justification is tempered by women's self-and group interests. We correlated, across nations, the gender gaps in HS and BS scores (men's mean minus women's mean), both with men's mean HS scores and with their mean BS scores. Men's HS (r = -.75, p < .01) and BS (r = -.65, p < .01) means were negatively correlated with the gender gap in BS (i.e., predicted a smaller or reversed difference between men's and women's BS scores). In contrast, the gender gap in HS was positively related to men's average HS (r = .61, p < .01) and BS (r = .41, p < .10) scores (i.e., the more HS and BS were endorsed by men, the more strongly women, relative to men, rejected HS). These opposing relationships fit our hypothesis: The more sexism pervades a culture, the more women are, relative to men, likely to embrace BS but to reject HS. 7",
          "We noticed post hoc that nations in which respondents exhibited low HS-BS correlations tended to be those with higher overall sexism scores. Across nations, men's HS and BS means correlated -.65 (p < .01) and -.49 (p < .05), respectively, with men's HS-BS correlations; women's HS and BS means correlated -.30 (ns) and -.52 (p < .05), respectively, with women's HS-BS correlations. Given that the HS-BS correlation is weaker among respondents in more sexist nations, perhaps it is also weaker among more sexist individuals. This might explain why men, who tend to score higher on sexism than women do, often show lower HS-BS correlations. Within each national sample, we performed a median split (separately for men and women) on HS scores and then computed separate HS-BS correlations for high and low HS scorers (we chose HS arbitrarily; a median split on BS would presumably yield similar results). These new HS-BS correlations were then used for cross-national comparisons. We performed a 2 (gender of respondent) × 2 (level of HS: high vs. low) ANOVA using the HS-BS correlations for each sample as the dependent variable. Because this ANOVA was performed with nations as the unit of analysis, both independent variables were treated as repeated measures (i.e., there were high-and low-HS-scoring men and women in each nation). There was a significant main effect such that across nations, people who scored higher on HS (average r = .07) exhibited weaker HS-BS correlations than did those who scored lower on HS (average r = .26), F (1,18) = 37.48, p < .01. The interaction term was nonsignificant, F(1, 18) = 1.47. In summary, at the level of individual respondents, HS-BS correlations decreased as, across nations, mean sexism scores increased. A similar phenomenon occurred when, within each nation, men and women were divided into low and high scorers on sexism (using HS scores): The more sexist individuals tended to exhibit weaker HS-BS correlations. Thus, the tendency for men, as compared with women, to show weaker HS-BS correlations may occur because they are typically more sexist than women are.",
          "Sexist ideologies maintain as well as reflect societal gender inequality; therefore, across nations, HS and BS means should be negatively correlated with national indicators of gender equality. Admittedly, our data are imperfect for these cross-cultural comparisons, given that (a) people in all but one of our samples cannot be presumed to be representative of their country and (b) we have data from only 19 nations (which, given that nation becomes the unit of analysis, means that our N is low). These factors should, however, work against the possibility of finding significant crosscultural correlations between the ASI and gender inequality rather than privilege our hypothesis. 8 7 Women's mean HS and BS scores, which are correlated in the .80 to .90 range with men's HS and BS means, were also strongly related to the gender gap in BS, though not to the gender gap in HS. Women's HS and BS means,respectively, to the gender gap in BS, but only .08 (ns) and .39 (p < .10) to the gender gap in HS. 8 Some readers may wonder whether correlations of the ASI scales to the United Nations measures might be an artifact of the types of samples taken in each country. If (a) more diverse (nonstodent) community samples produced higher means and (b) diversity of sample was confounded with traditionality of country, the correlations between the ASI scales and United Nations indices might be inflated. This scenario is unlikely, given that type of sample and national sexism scores were not confounded in this manner. The country with the highest proportion of nonstudents was the Netherlands (highly egalitarian), and about 50% of the sample from another of the most egalitarian nations, Australia, were older adults. Among the countries scoring highest in sexism, the samples from Botswana, Cuba, Colombia, South Africa, and Turkey were exclusively, and the samples from Nigeria and Chile were predominantly (75-80%), composed of university students. About 40% of the respondents in the South Korean sample were working adults, but their means were similar to the students' means. We correlated men's and women's means on HS and BS with the two United Nations indices of gender equality. It is important to recall that the GEM assesses women's presence in elite, highstatus jobs in business (e.g., as managers) and government (e.g., as parliament members), whereas the GDI assesses women's level of development in education, longevity, and standard of living. Because nations with higher human development more generally are likely to have higher GDI scores (simply because the nation as a whole is wealthier), we controlled for national HDI scores when correlating HS and BS to the GDI. The correlations are reported in Table 4. Because men are the dominant group, their scores might be expected to be most predictive of gender inequality. Despite the limitations of our sampling, men's national means on both HS and BS tended to be negatively correlated with the GDI and the GEM. 9 Although the correlation of men's mean BS scores with the GDI and GEM were only marginally significant, the magnitude of these correlations was roughly similar to the significant correlations of men's HS scores to the United Nations statistics. Women's mean HS and BS scores were (marginally significantly) related only to the GEM, not to the GDI. Overall, the results suggest that both HS and BS are predictive of gender inequality.",
          "Prejudice is not synonymous with antipathy; the cross-cultural data presented here show that sexism encompasses subjectively benevolent as well as hostile orientations toward women. Although it is premature to claim that HS and BS are human universals, they do seem (as predicted) to be recognizable, coherent ideologies in a variety of nations, as demonstrated by the consistent replication of the complex factor structure of the ASI. The extremely strong (.80 to .90) correlations between mean levels of HS and BS across nations supports the notion that at the societal level of analysis, these are complementary forms of sexism. The HS-BS correlations among respondents within countries were more modest but (when significant) always in a positive direction, as well. Despite the positive correlation, BS generally predicted positive and HS generally predicted negative trait ascriptions when participants indicated the valence of their spontaneous stereotypes of women. Finally, cross-cultural comparisons showed that HS and BS means predicted the degree of gender inequality across nations: As HS and BS means increased, gender equality, as indicated by United Nations indices of women's empowerment (representation in highpowered roles in government and industry) and development (longevity, education, standard of living) decreased (although some correlations were marginally significant and the GDI was related only to men's, not to women's, mean sexism scores). In general, a high degree of cross-cultural consistency occurred in several domains: the structure of the ASI; the tendency for women, relative to men, to reject HS more so than BS; and the association of BS with more positive and HS with more negative spontaneous stereotypes of women. Furthermore, cross-cultural variations in findings were typically systematic and predictable: The fluctuations in HS and BS means from nation to nation were related to indices of national gender equality, the size of the gender gap in BS and in HS means correlated (the former negatively and the latter positively) with the overall level of sexism across nations, and the strength of HS-BS correlations was negatively related to overall sexism levels across countries. The finding that in more sexist (as compared with less sexist) countries HS and BS scores tended toward greater independence was replicated at the individual level: HS-BS correlations were lower among high-HS than among low-HS scorers. These results suggest an explanation for previous findings that HS and BS tend to be less strongly correlated for men than for women--men generally have higher sexism scores. Perhaps people who are highly egalitarian are more likely to recognize BS as a form of sexism and reject it along with HS (with fewer of these individuals rejecting HS but accepting BS), creating more low-low scores that inflate the HS-BS correlation. An implication of the weaker HS-BS correlations among more sexist respondents is that many sexist individuals are more purely hostile or benevolent rather than ambivalent toward women (i.e., a sexist individual might endorse one ideology and not the other). However, it is important to keep in mind that at the societal level, HS and BS increased or decreased in tandem. Across nations, men's mean sexism scores strongly predicted women's mean scores on both HS and BS, providing evidence consistent with the notion that disadvantaged groups adopt the system-justifying beliefs of dominant groups (Jost & Banaji, 1994); as men's sexism increased, so did women's acceptance of sexist ideologies. However, for HS, women's system-justifying tendency had its limits. Women in every country studied were (on average) significantly less accepting of HS than men were. Furthermore, across countries, the gender gap between women's and men's HS scores increased along with the level of men's sexism, suggesting an increasing resistance to accepting a hostile environment. In contrast, the gender gap in BS scores showed the opposite relationship to men's mean sexism scores: The more sexist the 9 Although past practice has been to use partial correlations to control for the positive HS-BS relationship when using the scales as predictors, the overwhelming correlation between HS and BS means when nations are the unit of analysis (in the .80 to .90 range) makes it impossible to pull the scales apart statistically. nation, the more women, relative to men, accepted BS, even to the point, in the four nations with the highest mean sexism scores (Botswana, Cuba, Nigeria, South Africa), of endorsing BS significantly more than men did. In general, relative to men, women were more accepting of BS than of HS, suggesting that members of subordinate groups fmd ostensibly benevolent prejudice more acceptable than hostile prejudice toward their group. The evidence is consistent with the idea that women adopt BS as a form of self-defense when overall levels of sexism in a culture are high. HS and BS work together as a particularly effective method of system maintenance: When men are high in HS, women have a strong incentive to accept BS to gain men's protection, admiration, and affection and as a means of avoiding men's hostility. Faced with hostility from a more powerful group if they choose to reject conventional female roles and rewarded with men's benevolence for conforming to those roles, it is not surprising that many women choose to adopt prescribed roles and the ideology (BS) that supports them (see also Eagly, 1987;Jackman, 1994;Ridgeway, 1992). This is similar to arguments made by Smuts (1996) and Jackman (1994) that the threat of male aggression leads women to seek protection by pair bonding with men. Such effects are ironic, as women are driven to seek protection from members of the very group that threatens or oppresses them, and the greater the threat (i.e., the more men endorse HS), the stronger the incentive to seek male protection (rather than independence). Is women's relative willingness to accept BS a problem? Although men's mean BS scores were only marginally significantly related to the United Nations gender inequality measures, the findings were consistent across both indices of gender inequality. Furthermore, the extremely strong (.80 to .90) relationships between HS and BS means (both for men and for women) across countries are striking: In this set of nations, higher BS scores were a constant companion to high HS means. That HS and BS go so strongly together is consistent with the notion that BS legitimates HS by allowing sexist men to see themselves not as hostile dominators of women but as their protectors, admirers, and intimates. Furthermore, BS may also be effective in undermining or preventing attempts by women to achieve equality by rewarding them for enacting conventional gender roles and by deflating the resentment they feel about men's greater power (as one is less likely to resent another's power if that power is used to protect oneself). This may explain why women's endorsement of sexist ideologies was related only to the GEM, which measures women's presence in elite occupations and roles, and not to the GDI, which measures women' s overall standard of living. In societies in which women accept sexist attitudes, many women may still be able to achieve a decent standard of living through men's provision but may be less likely to pursue male-dominated elite occupations and roles. In short, BS and HS appear together because they are the ideological expression of a complementary system of rewards and punishments that elicit women's cooperation in their own subordination (cf. Jackman, 1994). BS may continue to have an important role in maintaining sexism even in increasingly egalitarian societies. Whereas HS becomes a lightning rod for criticism and eliminating HS is the goal of those aiming for social improvement, the more subtle, seemingly favorable views of women related to BS are less likely to be questioned. Virginia Woolf (1981) realized that true gender equality will only happen when \"womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation\" (p. 40), but many women, as well as men, may remain resistant to such a change. Fortunately, our data suggest that reducing men's HS may free women to reject BS as well as HS. The cross-cultural comparisons we present are limited. Clearly, future research that replicates these findings with more representative samples from a wider array of nations is desirable. Nevertheless, our preliminary evidence offers substantial support for the cross-cultural prevalence of HS and BS. Furthermore, the strong relationships of BS to HS (with national means correlated in the .80 to .90 range across countries) and to women's subordination (as measured by objective indicators of gender equality) suggest that it is time to rethink the equation of prejudice with antipathy. BS is not simply patronizing but may be just as important as HS in justifying and maintaining gender inequality. Untempered by paternalistic benevolence, hostility toward women would likely arouse only resistance and recalcitrance from a group on whom men are dependent in their most intimate relationships; BS disarms this resistance. The idealization of women who fulf'fll male-defined roles and needs is a crucial complement to the demonization of those who defy male power and authority, creating a particularly effective system of social control whose grip women in many societies are still struggling to break."
